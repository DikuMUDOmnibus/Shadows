"{gNo mom!  {x He screamed as the tears fell down his cheeks.  His brother
was holding his arms by his side so he couldn't move.  He struggled to move
his head away from the shears but it was no use.  

{gAllen, bring me the razor son.  {x" he mother asked, as she dropped the shears
to the table next to her.  She grabbed her son's shoulders, holding him down
in the seat.  {gRaesan, son, we have to do this.  You have icky little
creatures living in your hair, we have to get rid of them.  {x

Raesan sat, sobbing.  She was right, he didn't understand and right at this
moment, he hated her.  He cried out, "{gPapa!  {x Before turning his head from
side to side, looking for the man.  

His mother froze, looking down at him as tear began to glisten her eyes. 
"{gRaesan..  {x" she said slowly, "{gYou know papa is gone.  {x" Choking back her on
tears as Allen returned grabbing a hold of the three year old thrashing
about in the chair.  "{gA sickness took him{x" she mumbled before sitting the
razor to what was left of the boys hair.  

*{rFLASH{x*

The carriage was bumping down the road away from his home.  Tears were
streaming down his eyes once again as he lifted a hand to rub his bald head.
A weak smile crossed his face.  Turning to look at the driver he confessed,
"{gYa know Allen, when mom shaved my head I kinda got used to it.  {x"

Allen kept his eyes glued to the road, "{gThat you did Raesan{x" was all he
replied, deep in thought.  "{gKeep an eye out on the area around us Raesan, I
won't tell you again.  {x"

Snapping back to reality he started scanning the country side.  It had been
5 years since his mother had shaved his head to remove the lice and now he
felt traumatized again.  He brother told him that the Aiel had came over the
Dragonwall and their mother had packed them up and sent them away in a
hurry.  

He pursed his lips.  He didn't know why they had to leave because of Aiel. 
They were from Klines, a small hamlet in Arad Doman.  He shook his head,
something felt wrong about this, he thought.  Like he had done this before. 
He settled down, looking around at the country side as the carriage plodded
ahead.

"{gYou got your books your Sister sent to you lad{x"?  The man in the corner
asked slowly.  

Valen stopped and turned to look at him.  The man was tall and thick,
despite his age.  Grey hair covered his head and the lines of care adorned
his face.  He smiled weakly towards the man, "{gYes Father, I remembered them.
{x" he replied before turning back to packing the rest of his belongings.  

Walking around to sit in the chair next to the bed, the old man said,
"{gThat's good lad.  You study those letters hear{x"?  He reached into his
pocket and out his pipe and strike box.  "{gI know there are some that look
down on us for having you sister Seane run off to join the Aes Sedai but
don't be listening to those goons.  She saved your life m'boy.  {x" he barked,
striking the flint to the box a few times and sticking it to his pipe and
taking a long draw.  

Valen grinned, continuing to move about the room.  He stopped a moment,
dropping to his knee's to check under his bed, retrieving a couple of his
favorite volumes.  'The journey's of Jain Farstrider' and a bio written and
copied by the Aes Sedai about Rodel Iturlade.  Standing back to his feet and
flashing his father a quick smile, he quickly packed the books into the
trunk that was on the floor.  

The old man leaned back in his chair, relaxing with his pipe.  "{gIt was 10
years ago son.  {x" he said absently, thinking about the past.  

Valen paused from searching his room to stop and look at his father.  He
smiled broadly, he knew what was coming.  "{gYes Father?  {x" he asked nicely
before rolling his eyes and going back to packing.  

Leaning his had back and closing his eyes, the old man began his story.  "{gI
was already an old man by then, son, 54 I was.  Our first girl, your sister
Seane was coming home for the first time in 24 years.  An Aes Sedai.  {x" he
began, raising his voice slightly at the mention of Seane and her being an
Aes Sedai, proud of what his daughter had accomplished.  "{gMy dear Dala was
about to pop, she was so pregnant{x" he continued, smiling from ear to ear. 
"{gBut her being 48, she shouldn't of been having anymore kids.  Wasn't
natural{x" 

Valen moved around the room a moment longer before he stopped, turning to
look at his father.  He had heard the story before, sure but his dad had
never spoken of his mother before.  He took a seat on the bed.  He didn't
dare speak, he didn't want his father to stop.  He waited patiently.

His father sniffed, a choked up expression crossing his face for a brief
second.  If Valen hadn't lived with him these past 10 years, he would of
never seen it.  "{gShe was going into labor when Seane arrived, thank the
Creator.  {x" he started back again, opening one eye while he took another
drag on his pipe to look at the boy.  "{gYour mother screamed, even when Seane
used the power lad, it crushed me.  There wasn't anything I could do.  {x" he
paused, shaking his head lightly.  "{gAfter a few minutes, you popped out,
pink and screaming.  {x" 

Valen pursed his lips together.  He really didn't want to think of that
image.  He looked off to the side, trying to hide his eyes from his father. 

The old man took another, long draw from the pipe.  "{gI'm sorry lad, we had
already lost 5 other children, I didn't have much faith left in me son.  As
soon as Seane took hold of you, I ran to Dala's side.  She looked fine.  {x"
he said a frown beginning to crack his mouth.  "{gShe smiled weakly saying
that she had finally gave me a healthy son.  {g" His father let out a long
sigh, finally leaning forward to look at Valen.  "{gAnd she really did.  {x" he
said quickly, trying to turn his frown away.  

Valen looked back at the man, seeing the tears glistening in his eyes he
immediately turned away again, his own eyes suddenly starting to well up at
seeing his father sad.  He heard a quiet sob escape from his father and he
felt his heart crack.  He didn't move.  He wanted to hear more but had never
heard that sound from his father, he was scared.  

"{gThats when she died son.  {x" the old man whispered, leaning back into the
chair again.  "{gSeane..  {x" he started, "{gI hated her for a long time over
{gthis, though I know it wasn't her fault.  {x" He let out a sigh, stamping out
his pipe.  "{gSeane turned to look at me with you wrapped up in her arms and
{gtold me she had done all she could.  She could of saved either Dala or you
and she chose you.  {x" the old man said, a touch of anger still grazing his
voice after all these years.  

Valen couldn't stop him self.  He began sobbing, tears rolling down his
cheek as he turned to look back at his father.  He had killed her, he
thought.  He stood and waddled over to his father in the chair.  Throwing
his arms around him, he continued to sob into the older mans shirt.

He father reached his arms around him, engulfing him and pulling him
close.  "{gThere, there son, it's not your fault{x" he confessed before raising
his large hand to the back of his sons head.  "{gShe was right in doing so
m'boy.  I have you.  {x" he said, squeezing him a little tighter.  Moments
passed as father and son embraced each other before Valen's sobbing began to
lessened.  "{gYour sister gave you to me, staying around the house for a
couple of days to make sure you were ok.  {x" he started again.  "{gWhen she
left, {x" he said, pushing Valen away from his chest to look at the boy, "{gShe
told me you was special son, she was right.  {x" 

Valen twisted to where he could sit on his father's lap.  He reached a hand
up, whipping away his tears.  "{gI love you Dad.  {x" he whispered, dropping his
head back down to the old man's chest.  

His father looked down at him, a broad smile now radiating across his face. 
"{gAnd I you, lad{x".  

After a few more minutes passed, Valen stood and began to slowly go about
packing up his belongings "{gFather.  {x" he called, as he looked through his
closet.  "{gI don't remember Seane..  {x" he confessed, his voice low.  "{gShe
used to send me things, you said, but not any more.  {x" The boy paused,
staring at the back of his closet and waiting for an answer.  

His father let out another long sigh before reaching a hand to his belt and
pulling a small pouch out.  "{gThese are the last things she sent son.  {x" he
said, holding the pouch out to him.  "{gJewelry, something that when your gone
boy and you ever find yourself in trouble, you don't hesitate to sell, you
hear?  {x" he barked as Valen took hold of the pouch.  

Valen grabbed the pouch but didn't open it.  Standing there, looking down at
the pouch he asked again, "{gYes Father but what happened to her?  {x" 

Another frown crossed over his fathers face.  "{gI'm not sure son.  She was a
Brown..  {x" he started, his voice trailing.  "{gWhen the Aiel came through
almost 6 years ago, I heard that some of the men spotted a woman in
Jehannah, carrying some jewelery like whats in that pouch lad.  {x" he said,
pausing to look at Valen.  The boy was about to leave him, no use hiding
things now, he thought.  "{gEven an Aes Sedai can be hurt if she don't see it
coming lad.  I never heard from her after that.  {x" 

Valen stood, staring at his father, another set of tears beginning to
glisten his eyes.  After a moment he simply nodded and pulled the pouch
close to his chest a second before putting it in his pocket.  

The old man smiled, "{gDon't feel bad son, she gave you those books and payed
for that nice lady, Mrs.  Gardner to come and teach you your letters.  She
was a good woman, don't you forget that.  {x" he added quickly.  His father
stood quickly, nodding to the boy.  "{gLieutenant Mathus will be here soon
lad, hurry up with your packing.  {x" he said, smiling a weak smile down at
the boy before walking out of the room.

"{gMeow..  {x" called the small flurry animal riding behind him.  Valen
twisted in the saddle, looking at the small mound of fur that was riding
riding behind him.  "{gWhat?  {x" he asked quickly, "{gYou really think I care if
your being bumped around?  {x" The cat looked up at him, narrowing its eyes
before tucking its head back down between its feet.  Valen rolled his eyes,
turning back to guide the horse towards the outpost.  

He had been in a haze for most of the trip from the great wall, the long
ridge on Ghealdan's eastern border.  He had recieved a letter from Bethal,
just outside of Jehannah almost a week ago.  His father was dead and he was
heading home.  He had asked Lieutenant Mathus for leave as soon as he heard
that his father had passed on, it had taken 6 days for him to finally let
him go.  He had to see about the family's properity.  Valen reached down,
petting Arjento on the side of his neck.  "{gJust a bit farther my friend.  {x"

The road towards Jehannah wasn't very busy today, a few carts plodding
towards the city was all he noticed.  As he looked ahead, the city loomed. 
Another few hours and he would be there.  His mouth twisted, only once had
he actually been inside Jehannah, he had enjoyed it.  To bad he couldn't go
back now.  He twisted the reins, turning Arjento towards the southwest,
towards the tall wooden tower that stood a few miles away.  The cat behind
him meowed once again at the change of direction.  

As he neared the watchtower, cries echoed from the top, "{gRunner incoming.  {x"
Valen knew what was expected.  He dismounted from the large horse, stopping
a moment to scratch behind Blacky's ears.  The solid white cat raises its
head to his hand, purring loudly as he did it.  

As he turned back, leading his horse towards the watch tower, he retrieved
his orders from his inside pocket and watched as the tower's bannerman came
out followed by another man.  Valen stopped, saluting the man and dropping
his hand when the other man returned his salute.  "{gSir!  {x" he called loudly,
towards the men and held the small scroll out in front of his chest.  

The bannerman snatched it out of his hand and unrolled it.  Moments past,
with the man's eyes darting across the page before he nodded.  "{gYou know the
contents of this letter runner?  {x" he asked, his voice scratchy and gurgled
from the scar that adorned most of his neck.  

Valen shook his head, "{gOnly parts sir.  I am not allowed to read the
messages sir.  {x" he responded quickly, keeping his eyes forward.

The bannerman nodded quickly.  "{gVery well.  {x" The man turned, beginning
to walk away before pausing.  "{gYou're almost to your name day aren't you
boy?  {x" he asked.  Not waiting for a response he turned back, "{gStable your
horse near the tower.  We have a trade cart heading toward Bethal a little
later today, you can ride with them to your old home lad.  {x" The man looked
at him for a long moment before adding, "{gYou have 3 days, see to your
affairs then report back here to me, Bannerman Keirgrand{x" 

Valen snapped off a quick salute, "{gYes sir!  {x" he shouted back to the man. 
Keirgrand meerly nodded and turned away.  As he was leading Arjento towards
the stables, his mind was running rampant.  For most of the past 2 days he
had been remembering the time with his father and now?  He knew what 'report
back' meant.  He was being reassigned.  "{gWouldn't be the first time.  {x" he
muttered to himself.  Runner's went where they were needed, same as the
fighting men, just more so.  Especially runners without families.  

The rest of the day went as planned.  He had stabled Arjento and gathered
what belongings he needed for the rest of his trip.  Blacky had quickly
taken to the stable, as he always has, bounding up into the hayloft to hunt
for mice.  And the cart ride towards Bethal was going smoothly.  Thankfully
the driver, wasn't the talkative type.  Valen had no desire to talk about
where he was going or why.  

As they neared the town, he could begin making out the houses in the
distance.  "{gWilden's farm, Ollean's Orchard.  There's Mrs.  Gardeners house.
{x" he mumbled to himself, staring across the village.  He was afraid, a pit
of nerves were settling into his stomach and he immedeatly reached a hand up
to hold the two rings that were dangling from a chain around his neck.  "{gIts
ok Val, 4 years isn't long.  {x" he assured himself, still clutching his
sisters last present.  

As they started to move into the village, towards the green and the wisdom's
home he realized.  He wasn't scared of walking back into the town, seeing
the people, none of those things bothered him.  It was going home.  Sitting
by the fire with one of his books and his Fathers chair being empty.  Having
dinner alone, without the old man's slow, poking at his food.  Valen let out
a sigh, a lump starting to build in his throat.  "{gIts funny, the things you
miss isn't it?  {x" he asked towards the driver.  The man just grunted.  

The trip only lasted another few minutes before the driver start to veer off
the road.  "{gYour off here{x" he said, matter of factly.  The cart only paused
a moment before starting to lurch forward again.  Valen grabbed his canvas
pack and lept off, watching the driver carry onward towards the back of the
local inn.  Turning he looked across the green.  Nothing had changed. 
People were still milling about as usual at this time of day, kids were
playing in the street, some near his age.  He sniffed loudly.  Perhaps this
place hadn't changed but he had.

"{g...she's gone.{x"

The man stood in the doorway of the small bedroom, the bed perfectly made and
no personal items lying about.  To those who were not aware of the truth, it
would seem like there was never anyone here.

In the man's eyes, that wasn't far from the truth.  Just yesterday, the room
was chaos...typical of its former occupant.  Items strewn about, the bed
unmade...and yet, there was a life, an energy that she had brought to
everything she did.  He and his wife had taken joy in the girl's spirit, her
enthusiasm for whatever she did, the fact that under her apparent lack of
focus was a serious mind that could grow and accomplish what she needed to. 
There had been much life, much love in the house, and the village celebrated
in it as well.

Life was difficult sometimes in western Andor...a part of the lands that it
sometimes seemed forgotten among the squabbles of the southlands and the
constant struggle of the north.  Isolated, the people who chose to live here
did so by banding together, sharing, working towards goals that helped the
village.  There were disagreements, certainly, but they were settled as a
group.  Outsiders were looked upon with suspicion and not quickly accepted,
but once they were, it was as if they had always been a part of the whole.

The most dangerous outsiders, though, sought something from the whole,
wishing to take it away and make it their own...sweeping through the area for
their own ends and leaving the whole different, changed.

It was not well-known in the village, but his wife was a student of the White
Tower...a former student, one who was given the option to become accepted by
its walls and turned away.  She chose to live a life less complicated,
less...dangerous.  She put aside her knowledge and moved away, far away from
her former life, seeking a newer, simpler path.  She found it within the
forests and fields of Andor, and found someone to share it with...and, in
time, another joined the family, a beloved daughter, and with that, the
family was whole.

The man continued to stare into the room, thinking sadly on how the past can
make demands of the future...and how words can so easily destroy something he
thought perfect, without flaw...

"{Y...Papa...the Aes Sedai says that I can use the Power.  She wants me to go
with her so that I won't be a danger to others...and I think I should.{x"

Smoky grey eyes opened slowly, the ceiling of her room in the Tower gradually
coming into focus with the dim moonlight shining through her window.  Iero
groaned a bit and brought a hand to her eyes to cover them, but she knew that
she wouldn't be getting any more sleep tonight without help.  After several
minutes of debate, she pushed herself out of bed, wincing slightly at the
chill of the room before crossing it and drawing out a teapot and some herbs,
heating the former with a quick weave of Fire.

It had been years since the test, but some nights it still came back to her. 
'Was it real?  Did I dream it?'  She could still see the amusement in the
eyes of the Mistress of Novices as she asked and explained that practically
everyone asks the same when they step out of the first Ring.  She hadn't
written to her parents and asked, mostly because she was afraid that it might
have been true.  Knowing now how the Tower works, knowing what her mother
might have done did not sit well with her.

Pouring a cup of tea and sitting down at her desk, she sipped at it, feeling
the cold leave her and the herbs begin to take effect.  Enjoying the feeling,
she let her mind drift back to the rest of the memory, knowing that she
wasn't going to rest well until she reviewed it all.

The second Ring...she didn't remember much of it anymore.  It had been so
odd, standing again outside the room where the test would begin and being
told to quit.  She wasn't good enough, wasn't patient enough to ever become
Aes Sedai, and she should quit now and not waste the Tower's time any
further.  She couldn't help the feeling of anxiety, of thinking she had done
something to make them truly think this way, but she pushed forward.

As for the third, Iero still wasn't certain to make of it.  She was Aes
Sedai, that she could tell, but she couldn't see what Ajah she was, and she
couldn't ask anyone, since the Trollocs that were swarming everywhere made
conversation impossible.  A pair of Greens managed to stumble out of the
melee, one carrying the other who was almost torn to shreds, and their Gaidin
were trying desperately to hold the line and allow them back.  Twins, they
were..."{YJanccy and Lanccy.{x" Iero said to herself, though she wasn't sure
why the names came to mind or why they sounded familiar.  They were begging
her to help her Sister, to bring her back, but it was clear that the position
they held was to be overrun soon, and with the retreat, she'd been forced to
abandon the women to their fate.  A tear crept out of her eye that she softly
brushed away, firmly believing that it wasn't set in stone.  It wasn't
guaranteed.

She rose then and crawled back into bed, hoping that she would be able to get
some rest...and maybe find a way where her dreams would trouble her no longer.

Calling Andor your homeland is both a blessing and a curse.  It is
immediately recognizable and immediately judged.  That being said, if you're
looking for a little adventure Andor is a great place to start.  

Iocho knew that somewhere in his lineage there was the blood of a great
house, but he also sought no advantage from such heredity.  He had seen
enough privilege due to this tenuous connection to someone greater than he. 
He had been taught by learned men, trained to protect himself by seasoned
weapons masters and granted access to society's pomp and circumstance.  All
the time he was doted over he watched those that served wallow and often
sink into obscurity.  

Then the Aiel War found Andor and Iocho found his chance at adventure.  To
Cairhien he ran.  For Ciarhien he fought.  In Cairhien he was forever
changed.  In a topless tower he saw the pattern for what it is, a cold,
indifferent chaos.  

Like a river of mud, the veiled warriors pushed him and his Spartan regiment
higher and higher into one of the arrogantly constructed towers of Cairhien.
A homage to some bloodline's greatness.  Now, little more than a death trap.
As smoke slowly pushed the air from the stair well the veiled figures began
to recede, leaving the rest to die in by fire.  Breathing became impossible,
light was nowhere to be found and life soon would depart from those trapped
in the tower.  

"I have done what I can for this one," a soft voice stated matter of factly.
"These Andoran mercenaries serve as little more than a nuisance to the spear
wielding savages.  The woman pulled her yellow shawl tightly as she left
Iocho's bedside.  Her words rang in his head," Andoran mercenaries."  

Iocho sunk into blackness.  He was so very tired and his recovery was just
beginning.

Life growing up on the streets was never easy, but for girls it was
doubly difficult.  Jomissa could just remember when she had her own bed and
a home, but she and her brother had been alone for so long, the memories had
become faded and blurry.  She knew that their father had been a soldier in
the Aiel War and that their mother had sickened when he didn't return after
the War.  She knew these things from her brother but didn't remember them
herself.  

After their mother died, her brother sold everything that could be sold to
keep the two of them together in their home, but a boy of fifteen couldn't
do much to prevent the inevitable, though he did manage to delay their
having to leave their home until winter had passed.  And, by the time the
wheel had turned and winter returned, they'd managed to find a sheltered
spot in an alleyway to sleep in.  Tucked in the corner between the outer
wall of a chimney and a wall with a deep eave, they managed to stay mostly
warm and mostly dry...  And mostly hungry.  

It was her brother who chopped off Jomissa's hair and taught her to keep it
short.  Disgusing her as his younger brother instead of younger sister kept
some of the worst of the street thugs and heavies from paying her much
attention and it let her tag along as her brother fell deeper and deeper
into the local thieves guild.  She learned many of the same skills but hated
the changes that learning them had made in her brother.  

When he'd been caught last spring taking part in a heist, judgement and
retribution had been swift.  The law demanded the loss of his hand as well
as years spent in the city's jail, but the rules of the theives' guild were
even harsher.  Though his death was reported as accidental, Jomissa knew
that the guild enforcers had ordered his death.  Just as she knew that they
would soon start looking for his little brother.

Deep shadows ruled the alleyways of Baerlon, hiding those who did not wish
for noteriety in their murky depths despite the brightness of the day.  It was
down this alley that a sandy-haired man stumbled, quite drunk but obviously
pleased with himself.  His clothing was well-appointed, marking him as
someone with means, though it was currently in disarray due to his
celebrating.  A ring sat prominently on his left hand with a symbol of one of
the minor houses in Baerlon.

He practically giggled to himself as he continued to stagger down the alley. 
He knew he'd had far too much today, but he simply couldn't help it; he was
finally moving up in the world.  His father had finally seen the skills he
possessed and was considering allowing him more control over the house's
operations thanks to his recent successful trip to Inishlinn.  More prestige
for the house and fun to be had besides...everything was going his way.

When he reached the darkest point of the alley, a figure could be seen
entering from the other side, a tall figure bundled in a forest green cloak
with the hood up.  The noble grew wary, narrowing his eyes blearily at the
figure, but returned his concentration to keeping one foot moving in front of
the other until he ran into something, surprise making him stumble back and
fall to a sitting position.  Angrily, he looked up at the cloaked figure
standing in his way.  "{RWhat was that for, you lout!  Get out of my way!{x"

The figure didn't respond, his face mostly obscured by a hood and what was
visible obscured by a black beard.  After a moment, he spoke softly. 
"{g...the boy died, you know.{x"

The noble blinked once while in the process of getting back to his feet,
confused.  "{RWhat are you talking about, ruffian?!?  Leave before I inform
my father of this!{x"

The figure didn't move, his hands hidden by his cloak. "{gIlen Tamand.  From
Inishlinn.  The one that happened to be walking by when your men were
roughing up one of the locals.{x"

The noble drew in a sharp breath, sobering up quickly.  Turning his nose up,
he sniffed and says, "{RI'm sure I don't know what you're talking about, and
I will have you run in if you continue to speak such about my family.  Good
day.{x"  The noble turned to go back the way he came, away from the figure,
but stopped quickly once a thick arm quickly wrapped around his throat from
behind, cutting off his air.  He couldn't speak and started flailing, but the
man behind him didn't react to any of it.

"{gYour men cut out his tongue, you wretch...and you gave the order.  He
drowned in his own blood.  I've been asked to return the favor.{x"  The man
said the last in a calm, offhand tone, as if speaking about the weather.

The noble continued to flail with all his strength, but the man would not be
moved, even when he started kicking back at his shins or clawing at the arm
around his throat.

"{gFor ordering the murder of Ilen Tamand from Inishlinn, your sentence...{x"
He loosens his grip around the man's throat for long enough to seize his
head in both hands and break his neck with a quick, savage twist.  "{g...is
death.{x"

The man dragged the body into the deep shadows of the alley, pausing only to
wrench the signet ring off the dead man's hand.  Pocketing it, he drew out a
small leather book with no title, flipping through a few pages before finding
what he was looking for and scratching out a name.  He then pulled his cloak
around himself and walked out of the alley, not looking back.

"{GI should cut you up.  {x" A voice to her right says, with the tone that
sounds like he is describing the weather.  The click of boots on the wooden
floor tell Vira that they are either on a ship or in a house.  

Vira opens her eyes, blearily looking around, unable to focus her gaze.  The
man seizes her jaw with a large hand, forcing her to look at his face.  His
hair was long, touching his shoulders, and a well-kept beard, his eyes a
deep, murky green.  He laughs at her, saying, "{GYou wont escape, I have you
tied up, and this gag in your mouth will make sure you don't make a sound.

"{GDid you really think that you could get away with touching me, you filthy

Vira, hard.  Stars appear in front of her eyes, and she sobs into the
bandana.  He grabs her face roughly again.  "{GStop it!  Shut up!  {x" Vira goes
still out of shock, her sobs stopping abruptly.  

Target head releases Vira and slowly begins to circle around her.  Do you
want to live?  He asks Vira, quietly.  Vira nods her head vigorously.  {gYou

done to you, I will kill you, do you understand?  {x" 

Vira nods, and the man picks her up and throws her on to a bed that was
behind her.  He reaches down and pulls of her undergarments.  Vira attempts
to struggle, but is stilled by another slap.  He unbuckles his pants, and
forces her legs apart.  "{GI'm going to enjoy this.  Keep them spread.  {x" He

"{YThat was quite a dangerous situation, you realize.{x"

Iero took the opportunity she had with her head down to roll her eyes before
struggling to her feet as the two other women who had been concealed nearby
stepped into the clearing, Leya Sedai wearing her yellow shawl and Relyna
Sedai her brown.  "{WYes, Leya Sedai, but I thought it was necessary...Vira
needed something to distract her from what was preventing her from using the
Power.{x"

"{yQuite an audacious plan, and well-executed, Accepted, but the fact remains
that you put yourself in severe danger.  With as close to her as you were and
in your current condition, you had no way to defend yourself if she did
something more severe than a wave of Spirit all around.{x"

Iero put a hand on the tree to keep herself steady and sighed.  "{WA
calculated risk, Aes Sedai.  Given what she's said she accidentally did with
the Power before coming here, I didn't want her to feel threatened and lash
out, and with the knowledge that there was an Aes Sedai ready to stop her
should it be necessary, I thought it would lead to a more benign use.{x"

Leya shakes her head at that, though a soft, indulgent smile is on her face
as she does.  "{YYou are a reckless person, Iero, but that's part of the
reason why you've done so well in your studies, and why your...quirks are

You need to assess whether they can survive and whether you would be making

much of yourself into your work, and it will end up hurting you.{x"

Iero curtsies slightly, wobbling a bit again but managing to keep her feet. 
"{WI understand, Leya Sedai...{x"  As she trails off, Relyna smirks.  "{yThe

Relyna stays still for a moment, turning to where the Novice had been sitting
and studying the residues of the weave.  Softly, she says, "{yShe turned away
a Shielding attempt without even realizing it.  At least the Accepted had the
good sense not to draw attention to it...the girl needs to be taught control

Snip, snip, snip.  Was all that Raesan heard today, as he began his daily
rounds.  For near two hours already, he had been trimming the hedges around
the Whitetower and the day's sun was beginning to really shine.  Sleep had
been hard in coming the night before and he had to stifle another yawn
before continuing with the shears.  A little off this bush, a few snips off
another.  For some reason, today, the sound of the shears had began to make
him feel slightly naseaus

His thoughts were drifting, "{gAster{x" he mumbled to himself, a sly smile
crossing his face.  He stopped the shears, turning his face to the sky and
let out a long breath.  The sun felt good, warming to his face.  The wind
was blowing gently around the hedges, it was peaceful.  Raesan turned,
pulling his straw hat off and dropping it to the ground.  His bald scalp
warmed up immediately.  

"{gYour a coward, Raesan{x" he said absently to himself.  The comment kind of
surprised him.  It was true though, he thought.  He was scared to leave
home, scared to lose his uncle, scared of Aes Sedai and now even scared of a
pretty girl at a pub.  Raesan let out a long sigh.  "{gI'm tired of being
scared..  {x" he mumbled, as he walked towards his garden shed.  Once there he
dropped the shears and clippers next to the door and turned, walking towards
the White Tower.  



It was almost nightfall before Raesan Demantes was allowed to sleep that
night and everything was running through his head.  He remembered vividly
dropping off his shears and walking towards the White Tower, he just didn't
remember why.  It didn't matter though.  Next to his new bed, was a brand
new set of clothes.  He had went to bed last night, dreaming of pretty girls
and trimming shrubs.  Tonight he knew his dreams would be different, tonight
in his bunkhouse, with his uniform waiting for him tomorrow...  He dreamed
of what was to come for him, as a recruit of the Tower Guard.

Valen stood looking towards the old wooden door in front of him.  He had
been standing this way for near 15 minutes, the apprehension of actually
walking into his old home, clearly taking hold of the lad.  Closing his eyes
and letting out a deep sigh he reached his hand out, grasping hold of the
door knob and giving it a slight turn.  "{gIts SO good to see you again boy! 
{x" came a scratchy voice from behind him.  Valen let out a quick yelp,
spinning and throwing his hands up in front of his face.  Before him stood a
woman with white whispy hair, the top of her head barely coming up to his
chest.  He grunted dropping his face into his hands.  

"{gGood day, Mrs.  Gardener, its good to see you again as well.  {x" he
muttered, finally raising his head out of his hands.  "{gI'm sorry I didn't
see you there, please forgive me Ma'am.  {x" 


The old woman smiled broadly as she looked up at him, a mischievous look
flashing across her face.  "{gBoy, you look like you seen a ghost.  {x" she
started, giggling as she said it.  "{gMy hair's not that white yet is it?  {x"
She said as she brushed passed him, opened the door and walked into the old
house.  Valen, letting out a mumbled prayer, smiled and followed.  

"{gEverything is where your Father left it boy.  {x" she called back over her
shoulder and she hobbled across the room.  "{gHe was a good man your Dad,
always willing to help.  And especially when old women were concerned.  {x"
she said, turning to look at Valen and nodding towards the tea kettle above
the fire pit.  

Valen got the hint immediately.  Moving over to grab the kettle and hand it
to Mrs.  Gardener, he sat down on the floor and retrieved the flint and some
dried grass from next to the pit.  A few strikes and within moments there
was a fire beginning to crackle to life.  "{gIts good of you to stop by Mrs. 
Gardener, I had expected to be alone for a while in the house..  {x" he said
cautiously has she handed him the filled tea kettle.  

The old woman turned, looking down the hallway towards the bedrooms.  "{gDon't
worry lad, your father went peacefully.  All his things are in the back and
I think he even left you a thing or two.  {x" she started, completely ignoring
Valen's comment.  After watching him hang the kettle above the fire, she
took hold of the old rocking chair that his father used to sit, next to the
fire and slid it a bit closer to the flame.  "{gI'll just sit here and warm
myself, look after the tea.  {x" she said absently, taking a seat.  

Valen's eyebrows furrowed.  He knew there was nothing he could do about it. 
Once that woman planted her feet, he wasn't going to move her.  For a brief
moment memory flooded in of him being small and her rapping him across the
knuckles with a stick when he couldn't read what she had wrote down.  He
smiled, looking at her for a long moment before turning and heading deeper
into the house.

Valen wandered into the hallway, pausing while standing between the two
closed doors.  He could hear Mrs.  Gardener milling around in the front
room.  Just sitting huh?  He thought to himself.  A brief moment passed
before he turned right, opening the door to his father's room.  As he walked
in, his steps slowed.  Tears were beginning to well up in his eyes. 
Glancing around, everything was still in place.  From his father's neatly
made bed, to his pipe precisely placed on his night stand.  Valen reached a
hand back around to the door, closing it behind him before slinking to the
floor and dropping his head into his hands.  

The sobs had began to slow as he raised up his head.  He didn't know how
long he had been sitting there but the sun did seem a bit lower on the
horizon.  He stood, looking around the room.  He took a deep breath, finally
walking over to the edge of his fathers bed and kneeling down.  "{gCreator.. 
{x" he started, "{gPlease find it in your heart to shelter my father Jantson, in
your embrace.  I hope he was welcomed home.  {x" sniffing back a couple of
more tears that were beginning to steam down his face he continued.  "{gTell
him I am sorry I wasn't here...  So sorry..  But I hope I have made him and
my sister Seane proud of me.  {x" 

As he knelt beside the bed, Mrs.  Gardener pipped in.  "{gAre you hungry
Valen?  {x" she called down the hall, "{gThere isn't much here and my grand
daughter is cooking over at the house.  It would be a delight if you two
could meet.  {x" Valen grunted, the woman always had impeccable timing. 
Drying his eyes on his fathers blanket he stood, hearing the woman call out
again.  "{gOh and when you come back out could you go in your old room, I
think I left my reading glasses in there.  {x"

Valen shook his head irritably, thinking why the devil would she leave her
glasses in my room.  He stood, looking around the room one last time before
muttering, "{gGood bye Dad.  {x" as a cold feeling settled into his stomach. 
Turning and walking out of the room, he proceeded across the hall.  Tossing
open his old bedroom door, he froze, midstride.  Across his bed was strewn a
uniform.  Clean and pressed.  Chest piece, leggings, cloak and all.  And
neatly arranged beside the clothing was a long scabbard sword, its hilt
wrapped neatly, with a note pinned to it.  He gently closed the door behind
him and stood for a long moment, staring at the site.  His head spun.  The
uniform was bright compared to the rest of the room.  Its glowing white
color showing in deep contrast to everything else.  

Valen let out a low whistle, walked over to the uniform and ran his hand
along it.  "{gWas this your's father?  {x" he asked the uniform before lightly
running his fingers down the scabbard of the sword.  He reached up and
pulled the pin, holding the note.  Opening it, he began to read.

"{gValen, if your seeing this.  Then I'm gone, I'm sorry lad.  I wanted to
let you know son, I'm proud of you.  You going off to join the army,
becoming a running for the Legion.  A father couldn't ask for anymore than
that.  {x" 

"{gIf Mrs.  Gardener done her job right, before you should be what I have left
of your Grand Father's belongings.  We never did speak of my father much, I
know son but there were reasons.  I doubt you ever meet but I want you to
remember a name for me.  Beauford Taylor.  He was a good man and a good
friend to this family.  Your Grand Father was a great man, an officer in the
Children of the Light.  I won't tell you all the details but after your
grandfather learned that we had Seane and they she had been tested, all
those years ago.  I just can't describe to you..  I was disowned.  {x" 

"{gI wish I could of made things better with my Father but I wouldn't turn in
my only living child at the time.  Fortunately I didn't have to make a
choice.  Your Grand Father went off to war, I just knew that when he got
back I was a dead man.  Your father was an amazing swordsman, even when he
got old.  But during that war, what people call the whitecloak war now, he
was killed.  There was a big battle down south, with Altara and Illian.  And
some Illian group, called the bee's, killed your grand father that day and
honestly, saved our lives.  I'm sorry Valen, I should of told you this
before but I just didn't know how to start.  {x" 

"{gI figured they would come for us anyway but that man I mentioned, Beauford
Taylor a soldier then, he brought back your grandfather's things and told us
that no one would be comming.  That we were safe and that he would make sure
we stayed that way.  I haven't heard from the man in many years but if you
ever need help some, look for him.  He'll help you if he's still alive.  So
I'm leaving this to you my boy.  I was never a soldier, just a man.  This
family was great when your grandfather ran it and it will be great again
son.  I know that.  {x" "{gTake care my boy..  I love you.  {x" 

Valen closed the letter, sliding it into his pocket and carefully lifted up
the sword.  It was light, lighter than the blasted Iron one they had him
swinging for practice.  Slowly removing the wrapping around the hilt he
gasped, the golden heron was engraved there.  He slide the blade out a few
inches, just to check and sure enough, another was branded on the blade. 
Valen shook his head slowly, "{gYour right dad, he was a great man...  But not
a good one.  You were better.  {x" he muttered to the blade as he slid it back
in and layed it down on the cloak.  Wrapping the cloak around it tightly, he
picked it up, carrying it under his arm and walked out.

He stood in the shadows between two buildings, watching the wagons
rolling slowly down the rutted streets towards the edge of town.  The
village children followed their progress, laughing and playing like a
clatter of colts as they watched the unfamiliarly styled wagons, more like
houses on wheels than the wagons used by the merchants they were used to. 
He watched as the last wagon passed, a pained and yearning expression on his
face, then stepped out from between the buildings and started walking in the
opposite direction, one hand gripping the hilt of the sword at his side.  

The villagers ignored him as they chattered about the Tinkers who had passed
through, the women discussing the pots repaired and pins purchased while the
men grumbled amongst themselves and eyed the children as though counting
them.  Caliam shook his head and grimaced faintly as he heard some of the
oft-repeated untruths about the Tinkers but didn't stop to correct the
villagers as he ambled through the the streets and eventually into the
countryside beyond.  

Ahead, he could see the top of the Dragonmount in the distance, its peak
higher than the day before as he made his way across the plains towards it. 
The mountain wasn't his ultimate goal but was the only landmark he could see
this far out.  Eventually, he knew, he would be able to make out the White
Tower, the tallest building north of Tear, but for now he would have to use
the mountain as a guidepost to ensure he kept on the right roads.

daunting, but the smells were what caught him the most by surprise and
briefly had him second-guessing his decision to come to Tar Valon.  

Dodging horses, wagons and the curses of teamsters, Cal made his way deeper
into the village, away from the bridge and the city beyond.  He fingered the
coins wound in a kerchief in his pocket and made his way from inn to inn
until he found on in which he could afford to lodge for the night on the
last of his coins.  

"Bath, dinner, clean and mend my shirt and pants.  Where's that spare... 
Oh, there it is."  He muttered to himself as he dug spare shirt and trousers
out of his pack.  "Better do the washing first so they'll dry by morning." 
Tasks laid out for himself, he put words into action.  By the time the sun
set behind Dragonmount, he'd settled down in his room to polish his boots
and every bit of wood, leather, and metal on his belt, sword, and scabbard. 
The plain blade wasn't anything special, the dark metal more iron than
steel, but it defined the choice he'd made and he would have it looking its
best when he presented himself.

The remaining of the evening had progressed as Valen had figured.  He
kept his grandfathers blade, wrapped and tucked into his baggage as he
visited his fathers grave.  It was a wonderful spot, back behind the town
towards the west.  The spot was well kept and various people had left an
arrangement of flowers.  It made him happy, to think that his father had
drawn this much attention.  He had truly been a good man.  

After that visit he had found himself sitting around Mrs.  Gardeners dinning
room table, talking over the normal things that people do.  The weather, how
his life was, what he had thought about his fathers resting spot.  It drove
him insane.  Unfortunatly he had also been introduced to Eustice, Mrs. 
Gardener's only surviving Grand Daughter.  He was nice as he possibly could
be and Mrs.  Gardener knew that.  Eustice was almost 4 years his senior and
not the most best natured woman.  Having lost her brothers and family during
the sickness that took the area a few years back.  

By the end of the evening though, he was on the porch, figgiting with his
fathers old pipe and enjoying the cool breeze.  "{gSo boy, can I say I'm
sorry?  I shouldn't of tried to push poor Eustice towards ya.  Can't fault
an old woman for trying though can you?  {x" called Mrs.  Gardener as she
walked out onto the porch with him.  Valen just smiled towards the old
woman, retrieving his fathers striking box from his shirt pocket.  "{gThere's
nothing to forgive ma'am, though I did think that ol'Marten had Eustice in
his sites before I left.  {x" he finally responded.  

Mrs.  Gardeners expression faultered.  "{gThat he did lad.  {x" she started,
closing her eyes for a moment.  "{gThat fevor that took Eustice's family,
claimed your friend Martin as well."  {x Valen's eyebrows furrowed.  Martin
had been one of his close friends.  He remebered vividly of him and Martin
playing in the fields with his sister, Unia comming around to bother them. 
Martin had taught him all he knew of tracking back then...  He paused,
another one name to add to the list he supposed.  

"{gAnd his sister?  {x" he finally managed to ask, has he struck a fire into the
tender box and laid flame to the tabac in his father's pipe.  A wave of
coughing fit took him as Mrs.  Gardener looked on with a knowing smile. 
"{gBlast{x" he coughed, "{gHow did father ever smoke this thing?  {x" The old woman
shook her head slowly before answering him.  "{gUnia is alive and well
actually.  After the fevor struck the area she was apprenticed to our
village wisdom.  You remember her right, lad{x" she asked.  Valen nodded
slowly.  "{gYou should pay her a visit before you head out, I'm sure she would
like to see you.  Unia as well.  {x" He nodded again, taking another drag off
his father's pipe before stamping it out, coughing again as he did.

The first few mornings Caliam spent in the barracks were some of the
worst of his life.  The barracks were dark - but not like the darkness of a
night spent sleeping in the woods, they smelled bad - stuffy and of the
nineteen other men sleeping in the Recruit room on the rows of cots, and
they were noisy in a way he had never expected.  Snoring, the sounds of the
wooden cots creaking as the sleeping men tossed and turned, and footfalls of
the Guards on duty and patrolling the barracks all combined to keep him from
sleeping soundly despite the exhaustion his body felt.  He arose each
morning very nearly as tired as when the lights had been extinguished and
far more sore.  

After a week, he'd begun to settle into a routine.  The early morning
wake-up by the Sergeant, followed by a half-glass of exercises to keep the
Recruits limber.  This was followed by a full glass of marching in full gear
along the Shining Walls.  Of course, the climb in full gear was exhausting
in itself the first few days, but by the tenth day of the week, he was able
to at least reach the top of the staircase without wanting to fall over. 
Others in his troop were not quite so fortunate.  After the march, they
returned to the barracks to bathe and break their fasts.  By the time they
finished, the sun was well up in the sky and they spent the remainder of the
morning in class.  The laws of Tar Valon and of the nations surrounding the
island city, ways to identify thieves, how to detain a lawbreaker, the basic
structure of the White Tower and the Ajahs within; there were more classes
and topics than his family had books.  The classes let out for lunch and the
Recruits had an hour of 'leave' to do whatever the Sergeant had decided they
would do to 'relax'.  At the end of the 'leave, ' they were expected to
report to the Practice Yards for weapons training.  

The weapons training was where Caliam had the most difficulty and lagged the
most behind the others in his troop.  The Sergants were merciless in their
demands even though little of what he was learning bore any resemblance to
what he thought warcraft would be.  Of course, none of the others spent the
hours raising and lowering heavy wooden swords and shields to strengthen
their arms as Caliam was required to do.  Neither did they have any
difficulty in facing off against one or more of the troop in the counted
drill the Sergeants worked with them on.  It wasn't easy for Caliam, but
fortunately the Sergeant mistook the shaking of the practice sword for
weakness in his arm and not the stark fear that it really was.

"{WRemember what must be remembered.{x"

Iero didn't dwell on that, simply taking stock of her surroundings.  She
first noticed her state of undress, but she felt that she must not allow it
to bother her.  The air was heavy and damp, carrying with it a rank stench
that she could not identify.  The walls were slime-coated stone, and the
sound of dripping water could be heard off in some direction.  Oddly, a
tunic, trousers and boots sat not far from her, and she put the clothing on
without haste.  Once dressed, she gave more of her attention to her location,
determining that it must be a sewer of some sort.  In the distance, she could
see a symbol that looked like a six-pointed star engraved on the wall, and
she chose to walk in that direction, the sound of her boots against the stone
echoing around her.

After an indeterminate amount of walking, she paused as she noticed a stone
slab rising out of the water flowing through the center of the corridor she
was in, one with a six-pointed blue star etched into its surface.  She
briefly judged the depth of the water before stepping into it, the muck deep
enough that she had to haul herself up onto the slab, her boots filled with
Light knew what.  Still, she knew with certainty that she had a task to
perform, her focus on her work.

She embraced the Source, beginning to step through the first weave, and as
she did, the sound of water grew louder.  She paid attention enough to notice
that the level of the flow moving past the slab was indeed rising as well as
getting faster, suggesting that the spot she was in was soon to be
underwater.  As it rose, she split her flows and  wove a narrow wedge of Air
in the path of the flow, helping to divert it around her.

Her weaving continued, her shield being battered by the force of the water as
well as detritus that was caught up in the flow, but as she finished the
first weave, the water began to ease its force and slowly lowered again.  As
it returned to its previous level, a side corridor marked with the same blue
star could be seen nearby, and Iero calmly lowered herself into the water to
walk toward it.

**********

"{WRemember what must be remembered.{x"

Iero didn't dwell on that, simply taking stock of her surroundings.  She
first noticed her state of undress and various scrapes and signs of recent
injury, but she felt that she must not allow it to bother her.  The air was
radiating heat from fires that were burning near her position, though a plain
linen dress was sitting within arm's reach, which she pulled over her head
without undue haste.  The area looked familiar to her, her surroundings a
large clearing within a wooded area.  Buildings she could remember from her
youth were nearby, though wreathed in flames, and as she watched, she could
see people moving here and there attempting to fight the blaze or simply
fleeing from it themselves.  In the distance, she could see a symbol that
looked like a six-pointed star engraved on a post in the center of the
village green, and she chose to walk in that direction, the sound of her feet
against the ground drowned out by the crackling flames.

As she walked, she recognized more and more of what she saw, and the people
around seemed to recognize her.  She did not stray from her path or hurry,
simply continuing until she could see the star on the surface of the green. 
Stepping within it, she embraced the Source and began the weaving,
remembering that she was around half-done with them.  As she worked, more and
more people gathered nearby, all of them marked in some way by the
devastation being visited on the village.  Then, the group parted to allow
two people to pass...people she knew well.

"{yMother.{x"  Iero surprised herself with how calm her voice sounded, almost
distant.  Her eyes shifted slightly to the man standing beside the woman she
had addressed.  "{yFather.{x"

The man glared and turned his gaze away, crossing his arms, while the woman
looked at her with a pained expression.  "{BMy daughter...my beautiful
daughter.  I was afraid of this...when that blasted Aes Sedai came and took
you away.  I knew that they'd change you, turn you against your roots.{x"

Iero did not react outwardly, simply continuing her task.  The crowd was
beginning to mutter amongst themselves as the woman continued to speak. 
"{BYour people, your family is suffering!  Look at what is going on!  Can you
really stand there and watch as your home burns?!?{x"  The woman's voice had
risen to a shriek by the end, her expression distraught, and the man beside
her was livid, his fists clenched and his arms shaking.

Iero's glance flickered between her mother and father, then took in the rest
of the people standing before her.  At no point did she hesitate in her
weaving.  "{yWere there a way, I would help, and gladly.  However...{x"She
pauses for a long moment, as if trying to will the words out of her mouth. 
"{y...my duty is clear.{x"

The woman stared at her, openly crying by this point, then turned her back,
sobbing violently into her hands.  The man fixed Iero with a look of death
before turning to comfort his wife, and the rest of the crowd followed suit
shortly after.  Iero said nothing as she finished the weave, then turned to
look for her exit.  Seeing it, she began to make her way towards it, turning
her back on the crowd, willing her face to remain impassive while the
emotions storm within her mind.  The mental storm seemed to echo from the
crowd behind her, the murmurings growing louder until one person, then
several begin to chase after her angrily.  One step from the exit, a man's
hand clamped around her arm, but she touched his hand with hers while weaving
Spirit to bring a state of lassitude to her attacker, distracting him long
enough to step through.

"{WRemember what must be remembered.{x"

Iero didn't dwell on that, simply taking stock of her surroundings.  She
barely noticed her state of undress and did not react when she noticed there
was no clothing on hand.  Her expression was carved from stone, her steps heavy and
slow, but still she moved forward.  She could barely spare any attention at
this point to learn that she was in a hallway with white walls, but she could
see the six-pointed blue star further down the path through a nearby door and
so moved toward it.  As she moved, she began a litany in her mind that she
used to distract herself from her body and what it was insisting that she do.

"{yAcute fatigue, exacerbated from blood loss and possible dehydration. 
Multiple minor and some significant lacerations, though none currently
bleeding from what I can tell.  Burned patches on both arms and the palms of
the hands...none that should scar given Healing.  Multiple bruises, likely
from blunt trauma.  Two...{x"  She paused as she feels a sharp pain coming
from her side.  "{y...three cracked ribs.  No mobility of the left arm or
hand...dislocated shoulder with signs that an attempt was made to set it back
into place.{x"

She stopped her mental list as she found herself walking into yet another
familiar place, and a woman wearing a shawl with a yellow fringe quickly
rose from her seat at a desk near the entrance.  "{YLight!  Iero, what in
the name of all that is good happened to you?{x"  The Aes Sedai moved
forward, obviously intending to lead Iero toward one of the Healing rooms,
but the six-pointed blue star stood in front of the desk and Iero stepped into
it, moving away from the Aes Sedai.

The woman frowne at Iero's actions.  "{YWhat are you...{x"  She then gasped as
Iero embraced the Source and begins weaving, a dark look crossing her face. 
"{YYou would throw our teachings back in our faces like this?  Refusing my
instructions as an Aes Sedai and a healer, and channeling in your state? 
Explain yourself, child!{x"

Iero was well aware how she looked and what she is doing, but does not stop her
weaving.  "{yI am doing my duty, Aes Sedai.{x"  The woman scoffed at that, her
dark look remaining.  "{YAnyone who would take such a foolish risk in your
state is not fit to serve in the Tower.Cease what you are doing this
instant or I shall have you subdued.{x"

"{yMy apologies, Aes Sedai...{x"  She finished the last weave successfully. 
"{y...but it is done.{x"  Turning, she sees the six-pointed blue star on a
door across the hall, and she turns to walk toward it, neither hurrying nor
hanging back, leaving a small trail of blood in her wake.

**********

Her mind briefly regained enough focus to take stock of her surroundings. 
She was in her room, and a large tray of food sat within reach.Weariness
set into her bones, not helped by the large about of Healing that had been
required after the test.  She stared at the tray in front of her for long
minutes as if not understanding what she was looking at before weakly raising
an arm and grasping something, she didn't care what, mechanically bringing it
to her mouth.

As she ate and drank, she knew that she couldn't allow herself to remember
what she had just been through.  She knew that she would be left weeping and
broken thinking about the torture she had been put through.  If anything, the
sympathies of the Aes Sedai made the feeling worse, knowing that they were
the ones who forced her into those situations, rubbing every last nerve in an
effort to get her to break.  Softly, within her own mind, she admitted to
herself that she very nearly had.

After idly pawing at the tray in front of her and coming back with nothing in
her hand for a few minutes, she finally sank onto her bed.  With her Healing
came one small mercy; there was no possibility she had any energy to dream.

The days has blurred together and Caliam couldn't remember if this was
day eight of the week or day nine.  Either way, he knew he had to keep
pushing himself, to keep pushing the others in the squad.  The Sergeants
were as relentless in their pressure and the tasks the squad had to complete
as Caliam remembered from his first experience with the brutal final test a
recruit had to pass to fully join the Tower Guard.  Though the War had been
over for years, the designers of this week of torment remembered well the
lessons they had learned fighting the Aiel and used those memories to
simulate the conditions of war as much as they could without actually
risking the Recruits' lives 

They'd fought simulated battles at night on third and fourth nights followed
by hard marches the following days.  They had to ration the trail food in
their packs, but were able to fill their waterskins at least once per day
and got at least two glasses of sleep per night.  By the fourth day, half
the squad staggered through the march and by the sixth, everyone was
staggering.  Still, the Sergeant's yells kept them focused, or at least as
much as their tired minds could focus, kept them moving, kept them on task. 


The sixth day was a simulated assault against a fortress, complete with
siege machines.  Day seven, they reversed their positions and worked to
defend against an assault.  By this point, none of the Recruits were
unmarked, though no one had taken an injury serious enough to cause them to
withdraw.

It was day nine, Cal finally decided, and the Sergeants were no longer
urging the Recruits on.  Instead, they were urging them to give in, to give
up.  More than one was weak willed enough to give in to the cajoling and as
the sun set behind Dragonmount, Caliam realized that less than half the
squad were still on their feet.  They made it to their camp, the final camp
of the week, and it was all they could do to stay awake long enough to choke
down their trail rations.  

Each night, they'd taken turns keeping watch, but whoever's turn it was that
night had fallen asleep as well.  The surprise attack rousted them all and
the fighting was as fierce as it was ragged.  The sun was just rising,
blinding them as the Sergeant's yells filled the air.  The attackers dropped
back, no longer attacking, and the unmistakable order to hold kept the
Recruits from pressing forward.  Puzzled and muddled by exhaustion, it took
some time for the Recruits to realize that the testing was done.  

Gear and Recruits were loaded into wagons and carted back to Tar Valon.  The
Recruits barely noticed the arrival at the barracks but the Sergeants soon
rousted them.  It took them a few minutes, but Caliam finally understood
that the Recruits had a half-week to recover before giving their final
oaths.  They didn't have to use the entire five days, if they didn't need
it, but they had the leave to recover and make their final decisions.

The day's wind had chilled the tall man with black hair to his very core.
His cloak pulled tight he entered the Dancing frog, quickly making his way
to a table.  Saurison would do anything for a warm cup of mead.  

A petite slender woman is almost behind the tall man, pushing the door open
to enter before it comes to a complete close be him.  Glancing around to see
how full the room is while she rubs her hands together she gives him a once
over look before she shakes her head.  He has taken the only empty table
there.  So she follows him and just as he gets seated she speaks up.  "Mind
if I share your table with 

With a thud Saurison sets himself down, still wearing his heavy cloak.  The
petite woman's inquiry caught him by surprise.  One look revealed her
disappointment that he had taken the last table.  "Oh.  Of course.  I mean,
please...  Yes.  Here, do sit."  

A petite slender woman smiles her thanks and with a flip of a hand her
cloaked is off her shoulders and hanging from the back of the chair she has
settled down in.  Almost to the second she sits a serving girl appears at
the table.  "hi'ya Aster.  The usual?"  And then she turns her attention to
the man there.  "And how about you sir, what can I get for you?"  

The tall man fumbles with his cloak, nearly tipping his chair before finally
sloppily removing his cloak.  "Get me?  Oh yes...  Where are we, Tar Valon? 
Yes.  Of course we are.  Some warm mead, please."  Turning his attention
towards his guest, "Aster.  Well met, my name is Saurison."  

Aster watches Saurison removing his cloak, trying not to giggle.  She
succeeds but only by a hair.  "Well, I work here in the kitchen.  Just
showed up early today to get a mean and warm up abit."  Then she motions
toward the departing serving girl.  "That's Katling she knows what I like. 
The meat pie."  Then she turns her full attention to the man.  "Where did
you blow in from?"  

Saurison fusses in his chair; one leg appears shorter than the rest as he
wobbles back and forth.  "Ah...  Blow in from.  I see what you did there,"
he laughs to himself as he points to the swirls of leaves just outside the
window.  "There are so many roads that cross this land.  The one I was
following ended up here."  

Aster nods and the giggle is threating again while he fusses with his chair.
"The road I used was the river.  Worked my way to here then just stopped to
look around for a while."  

Saurison looks up with a start.  "Yes.  Much like myself.  Roads, streams,
things that lead places.  Some with currents!"  Having thoroughly amused
himself, Saurison lets out a cackle.  "OH, do forgive me.  You said you work
here, in the kitchen?  Do you cook?  I've always envied those who can cook
well...  Or at all for that matter."  

Aster looks down, to the side, up at the ceiling then with red cheeks she
admits.  "I prep the food for the cook."  Then she suddenly brightens up. 
"But, I am learning to make apple pie."  And just at that moment the serving
girl returns with food and drink...  And a wink for Aster as she says, "I'll
bring out a couple of slices, on the house for you two."  Then before Aster
can say yea or nay, Katling has run off toward the kitchen again.

Saurison cocks his head to the side, "How'd she know I love apple pie?!" 
The tall man fumbles through the pouches at his belt, retrieving a
smattering of coins.  "I'm going to give her a tip!  Before service has
ended!  That's how you show your appreciation for being treated like
royalty.  Unrestrained generosity."  In his hurry, Saurison drops several of
the coins on the floor.  An Andoran, Saldaean, and Fal Daran piece lay in
the mix.  "I hope she'll take one of these."  

Aster blushes brightly.  "It's not you that she knows about loving apple
pie, its me."  And her head ducks slightly.  "It's me...  She's just being
that way cause we are sitting together and she thinks I know you."  Her
voice is near a whisper with embarrassment by now.  But she does check out
the coins.  "Oh, don't worry.  We get a lot of people in here from all over
the place.  All coins are accepted."  

Saurison nods vigorously.  "Do you think she thinks I'm important?" 
Saurison's eyes open wide.  "I can come across pretty strong."  

Aster eyes him over again, smiles then nods.  "That's it.  I'm sure she does
think you are."  Then she peers a bit more.  "And are you?  Important, that
is."  

Saurison looks about, as though scanning the faces nearby.  He motions for
the petite woman too come closer.  Leaning down he says, "Absolutely not." 
Saurison throws his head back and roars with laughter.  "Oh my dear girl,
please forgive me.  The road can be so serious and sometimes I can't help
but throw the world out on its ear."  

Aster blinks at him then smiles again.  "Well, I'm ok if you are important
or not."  She picks up a fork to cut into the meat pie that had been served
to her.  "And anyway.  We all are important in one way or another."  The
fork slides into the folded pastry around the meat pie to let out steam and
a very yummy aroma.  

Saurison grabs the cup of steaming mead and pulls a long drink.  Without
bothering to wipe the froth mustache from his mouth he starts, "I had you
going to a bit.  Admit it.  You weren't, and probably still aren't sure if
you're sharing a table with some crazy.  Rest assured that I am merely
enjoying the journey."  Suarison picks up the napkin from the table and
wipes away the frothy mead mustache.  "So we're both travelers, you and I. 
Where did you blow in from?"  

Aster looks up, grins at the froth mustache then giggles when he rubs it
off.  "I like you with the mustache.  Have you tried growing one."  The
question about where she had blown in from seems to have either not been
heard or ignored.  

Saurison smiles to himself, "like a reed in the wind."  With a soft chuckle
Saurison pulls another drink from his mug.  "Aye, I've grown a fine mustache
before.  Large a sweeping like thick curls of black smoke billowing from my
nostrils.  They can be so formal."  The man fiddles through his pouches
pulling a pipe, a pinch of tabac and a lighting box.  "I decided enough with
such things, and I took a break from it...  And from myself."  

Continue.

Aster nods at him, not speaking until she has swallowed.  "Ah, getting
away from yourself."  She shakes her head at him.  "How do you do that?" 
She lifts her hand then pokes herself on her forehead.  "Can get away from
myself, I'm inside my own skin."  Then she giggles again.  "Is that another
joke?"  

Saurison lights his pipe with a few quick puffs.  He pulls in a long draw
from his pipe, mouthing the smoke before slowly billowing thick black smoke
from his nose.  He nods at his guest, pointing excitedly at his smoke
mustache.  "Like that!"  Saurison grabs the mug, pulling in another long
draw.  "Let me post a question, what is it that restrains us?"  He taps on
his forehead and pinches the skin on his arm.  "This stuff?  No...  It is
the world around that fights back hardest when one tries to change."  

Aster chews slowly, quietly and with a look of interest while she seems to
be thinking over the last of what he has said.  Finally after swallowing she
wiggles a finger at his nose.  "Would be a lot of work to up keep for
neatness, glossiness and beauty."  ...  "So, you are meaning to get away
from yourself is to not act as you usually act?"  

Saurison leans back a bit in his chair and takes a long draw from his pipe. 
He blows a few circles of smokes and obliterates the forms with a quick
exhale.  Taking the handle of his mug he states quite matter of factly, "You
carve out a way of behaving in the world.  Like a mold of yourself that
those around you will hold you to.  How does one escape that?  Me, I try to
just keep moving before the world holds me anywhere long enough to mold me."


Aster shrugs; it seems her giggles have suddenly vanished.  "Maybe it's some
can do it."  She seems about to say more when her name is called out and
when she looks up she is being beckoned to the kitchen by an older woman. 
"Time for work."  She stands then smiles again, "Hope you like my apple
pie."  There is no time to answer her before she is gone toward the old
woman standing in the kitchen door.

Practice, patrol, and polish.  Those seemed to be the whole of his days
now that he had settled into his rank and life at the Tower.  He was
starting to get a feel not only for where his patrols took him in the city
but also for the people, the shop keepers, the citizens, the children who
played in the streets, even the beggars and thieves that every city held.  

Practice was coming easier as well and he no longer found himself always
paired off against the weakest fighters.  He'd spent hours in the yards,
hours outside what each member of the Guard was required to spend in
practice, and the time spent was starting to show in other ways as well. 
Twice now, he'd had to request new uniforms from the quartermaster, a detail
the irascible old man liked to nag about whenever he could.  He was one of
the faction who thought that Caliam was a coward who would run at the first
sign of trouble and cost "real" guardsmen their lives, but that faction was
slowly beginning to shrink in size and Caliam could put up with his barbs
now that he was growing confident in his skills.  

What little free time he had between practice and patrols, he spent
polishing.  Boots, breastplate, helmet...  Each had to be kept shined and
gleaming at all times and the areas around the docks, his normal patrol
area, made it difficult.  Still, the earlier taunts from the others in his
squad made spending the time alone more pleasant than they realized.

He opened his eyes wider at what lied before him, blinking in disbelief. 
During their trip from Klines, they had passed through Maradon and Chachin,
those were increadable enough but this.  He looked down to see Allen was awe
struck as well.  The White Tower glistened in the sky, like a silver spike
pointing towards heaven and Tar Valon unfolded around it.  

The boy was speechless as they were led into the city.  Apperiantly the city
was beginning to fill up from refuges that had flooded in as the Aiel had
pushed the armies opposing them back towards the city.  In a brief moment of
sadness he wished his mother was here.  As they were led forward, Allen
called one of the guardsmen to the cart.  

{gSir, {x he started cautiously, "{gI have an uncle near the tower that will be
taking the boy.  {x He raised a thumb pointing it back towards Raesan, "{gAnd
I'll be looking to enlist.  {x" 

The guardsmen nodded motioning them onward.  Raesan turned to Allen, and
screamed.  "{gNO!  You can't just leave me here!  {x" as the tears began to
glisten again.  Allen ignored him and continued to drive them into the city.




*{rFlash{x*

"{gIt's alright lad, your going to be ok.  {x" a voice called to him.  He was
freezing.  It was so cold in here.  Sweat beaded on his forehead as the
tall, grey-haired man blotted a damp cloth to his head.  "{gThis sickness
isn't going to take you lad, I promise{x" the voice called again before he
drifted back to sleep.  

*{rFlash{x*

They were surrounded.  The Aiel were outside, as was the Great Coalition,
pushed back to the city.  He had received a letter only a few days ago, that
his brother Allen had been killed when the Aiel pushed towards the city and
was buried somewhere in between.  

He was safe here, though.  Inside the walls of Tar Valon, even the Aiel
couldn't get in.  That wasn't what worried him.  His uncle Malak had been
giving them smaller and smaller portions of food.  He said that most of the
food was going to the soldiers outside the gates but the Aes Sedai were
doing what they could to help.  

He followed his grey-haired uncle back out to the tower courtyard where he
continued the lads education.  "{gAlright Raesan, you see these shrubs here? 
{x" the boy nodded, watching the old man.  "{gMake sure these are trimmed every
two days.  The Aes Sedai are our protectors but some of them can be quite
fickle.  {x" 

Raesan continued watching the old man go about his business as Gardner for
the White Tower.  Soon enough, he thought, this would be his job as well.

Rasesan sat up quickly, sweat rolling down his face.  "{gWhat?  {x" he
mumbled, shaking his head lightly.  It had been years since he had thought
back to those days.  He stood, throwing back the covers on his bed and
sticking a lighting stick into the remnants of the fire.  He smiled,
remembering fondly his family and his early days at the tower.  He raised
the now burning stick to his oil lamp, lightning it, as its glow flooded the
room.  

He gazed around the small, one room shack.  This was his life, he thought to
himself.  Gardener.  His eyes paused, lingering on a pair of oiled shears
that adorned the wall.  "{gIt's time to trim those shrubs again Uncle.  {x" he
muttered to them.  He walked over to his small pantry and dipped a wooden
cup into a bucket of water that he had drawn the night before.  Reaching a
hand up he grabbed a small loaf of bread and waddled slowly back over to his
bed for breakfast.  

As he ate, he remembered Malak tending to him while he was sick, dabbing him
with the damp cloth, bringing him water and sitting up all hours of the
night with him.  "{gYou were a good man, uncle{x" he muttered to the shears,
hanging on the wall.  He choked down a couple more bites of the bread as a
few tears began to glisten once again.  He wiped them away quickly.  "{gA man
grown, shouldn't be crying.  {x He said aloud, reinforcing the thought.  

Raesan stood, gathering up his own tools and preparing to walk out the door,
to start his day.  Looking back towards his bed, he noticed the spot on the
floor.  The wood was darker there he saw, that's where he fell, he thought
to himself.  "{gAs soon as I awoke, he died.  {x" he muttered, his lip quivering
slightly.  The man shook his head violently, trying to dispel the image
before turning back to the door and putting on his fake smile.  "{gOff to work
{gthen{x" he chirped, a pit still residing deep in his stomach.  Before opening
the door and heading for the Gardens.

There was no birthing cry from the newborn, just a soft mewling sound. 
The scream came from the trollop that had just given birth. "Get that 
thing out of my sight and give me some grog, I'm in pain."
>
The woman was given grog by the Madam of the place while a servent 
wrapped the baby in a dingy apron and scurried out of the room. None in 
the house but that old serving woman knew what happened to the newborn 
child. She had carried it over to Cairhiens overcrowded orphanage and 
left it sleeping on the doorstep.
>
Over crowded the orphanage might be, but it was backed by a minor noble 
spinster. A plain woman that was never married and as all spinsters are 
pron to do, she had love for any child that came into her area. She 
visited the orphanage offted giving her love there. And as all 
spinsters do, she died alone in her small run down manor.
>
Alass all of her fortune was gone, secreted away by lawyers, estate 
managers and crooked bankers. The Orphanage had to close down and a 
couple of dozen small children were turned loose on the city of 
Cairhien.
>
The child was now called Aster and three years old, thin and pitiful 
looking. Just right for begging and one of the older children, a boy of 
12 almost 13 took charge of her and soon had a nice income on their 
chosen corner to beg. He found a place for them to live in an alcove in 
the sewers under the city. Not so bad a some, because water from the 
river kept it flushed out.
>
At first Albert (that was one of his names) took care of Aster because 
he knew he could get good money by holding her hand and begging on 
amost any street corner. That soon evolved into affection of the 
brotherly type. So he became even more protective of her and when the 
Aiel invasion hit Cairhien he took her with him to try to find a safer 
place to hide.

This he managed by staying under the city. He had learned his way 
around most of the maze of passages there and only had to worry when 
heavy rain fall made the river rise to flood some of the lower passages 
where they hid.
>
Time passed and so did the war and danger from the Aiel. Slowly 
Cairhien begain to pull itself back together and the urchen beggers 
reappeared on the street corners. The only drawback was that Albert was 
too old now and even with the much younger Aster alone with him, she 
gain more coin alone than she did with him nearby.
>
So Aster became the one to bring coin in while Albert seemed to fail at 
anything else he tried. He grew even thiner,,, and a bit stranger. Day 
by day, Albe, as she called him, became more secretive, more pale and 
hardly eating so that he becaem even more thinner. So, day by day she 
worried more and more about him. "Please, please, Albe, eat. Look what 
I've brought to you, apples."
>
The basket of apples she was holding suddenly flew from her hand to 
slam against the wall of the room with apples flying everywhere and the 
basket bursting into flames. Albert gave the 14 year old Aster a sad 
look. "I'm a man, Aster. A man and I can't protect you as much as I did 
when I was a child." she ran toward him to wrap her arms around him, 
crying out. "don't Albe, I love you."
>
Then she slammed into a wall. A wall she couldn't see and fell back to 
the floor crying. Albert looked down at her and yelled, "get out get 
out! Now now! Save yourself!" She stood up and slowly backed away from 
him. -This wasn't her Albe, not anymore. Not with eyes that looked like 
that- So she turned and ran, crying from the room while behind her a 
wall of flame circled the young man.
>
Aster ran and ran toward the docks after pausing to look behind her 
just one time. The thick smoke and roaring flames sent her into flight 
again with her hear and mind crying for the loss of the one person that 
hand been her family.
>
Through the next few years she took care of herself, keeping the 
madams, pimps, drunks and officals at bay. She called herself by other 
names, learned to steal, pick pockets, cut purses and the use of knives 
to protect herself and to threaten others when they threatened her.
>
This life ended when she was 16 and she killed a man who would not take 
her word that she didn't steal from him and he souldn't try to beat her 
for it. On the run in the guise of a boy, she worked her way north on a 
ship then reverted back to her true self as a female with her true name 
that Albert had given to her, Aster.
>
Now she had a job in the kitchen of one of the inns in Osenrein washing dishes, scrubbing pots and peeling potatoes, onions, ect and the occasional theif.

Candra learned to avoid (when she was able) the Terrible
Threesome. So did the other novices. And every time they
were punished for some fraction they had bent, broken or
just ignored, Candra's spirit lifted and her days grew
lighter despite the studies and chores that were demanded.
 
Then suddenly the Three were now Two. One of the girls,
There was buzzing up and down the hall in the Novices
area. Words spoken in shocked whispers and by the time
that Candra had reached the dinning hall for breakfast
she knew what had happened. To be truthful she was both
happy and horrified about what had happened to Bethany,
of the Terrible Three.
 
{W!!!Burned out!!!{x
 
Candra knew now what that meant. Never to pull in that
wonderful feeling .... She cut that thought off quickly
to look around before settling down to eat. The whispers
slowly grew louder untill the room rang with the shocked
quiries. 'How did it happy?" more to the point. "Why did
it happen?'
 
And through out the next hours between the morning meal
and the noon meal those questions were asked over and
over untill finally the answers came. Bethany had learned
a weave that was not supposed to be taught yet. Shielding.
And being the person she was, she had tried to use it
against another girl that the Threesome had been tormenting.
Tried to use it and failed. This led to Bethany's growning
anger and she kept trying and trying and grasping more and
more untill she suddenly crumpled to the floor.
 
By the end of the day the rumor mill was going full tilt
with a dozen different places that she had learned the
weave. The one most believed was that she had become a
servent of the.... Shadow. Candra didn't add to the rumors
she didn't know and she didn't say. But her thoughts were
mixed on it all.
 
One thing for sure, her top most feeling was one of joy at
being free of the torment that Bethany had spread to anyone
she felt like tormenting. Now she was in the care of a Yellow
Sedai. A messagenger had been sent to talk to her family to 
have them come to the tower to conference with the Mother
and the Yellow Sedai that is now taking care of Betheny.
 
A month later and Betheny was gone. But of the two remaining
there had been no trouble. Did they fear that what happened
to Bethany would happen to them. Were the Sedai on a more
close watch of the remaining two, Janccy and Lanccy. Sisters
that were twins. Or were they just waiting untill they were
no longer under close watch to start a new run of terror.
 
Some of the others, the weaker ones, seemed to be in constant
fear of what was yet to come. Candra and others like her,
took a wait and see atitude while she went about her business
with chores and lessons.

Aster sat in the corner of the kitchen among stacks and stacks of baskets 
filled with apples. Apples to the left of her, apples to the right and... 
well you get the picture. The Cook had declaired that apple pies were in 
order and apples needed to be peeled, cored and cut up.
 
Aster wasn't the only one peeling things. There were others working on 
potatoes, turnips and onions. This latter person, a boy of 13, cried 
openly as the piles of prepaired onions mounted higher and higher one 
the table he was standing in front of. Wipig his eyes on his sleeve, he 
called out to Aster. "Hey, want to swap for a while?"
 
Caught in thoughts of her foster brother Albert she didn't answer at 
first, he had to call out to her again before she looked up with a dazed 
expression and a bright red apple held to her chest. "Huh?" she blinked 
her eyes as if to wake up then slowly stood up. "sure I don't mine." the 
apple was slipped into her pocket as she moved from her chair in the 
middle of the baskets to the table where the onions were.
 
Swapping knives with the boy she turned to the table while he made his 
way to take Asters place with the apples with a smile of reliefe. "Thanks 
Aster." he called back before he sit down and got to work with peeling 
them. He begain to whistle, but it wasn't out of place. Others were 
humming, whistling, singing and chatting to pass the time while doing 
such a humdrum job.
 
Most of the oinions had been peeled, so she started off with the job of 
chopping them for the stews that Cook had also planned for the menue. Now 
her thoughts of Albert faded and another face took the place of his. The 
gardener from across the river, Raesan. Her lips twitched into a smile. A 
nice man, interesting with his fondness of shaving his head. She had 
never known anyone that liked to do that before.
 
Shoving one pile of onions over to make room for more, her thoughts also 
added that young woman from the White Tower that she had met the same 
night as the gardener. What was she called... oh yes, Iero. She said she 
was an Accepted. Aster blinked back tears caused by the onions and 
suddenly wondered if she would ever meet Raesan again,

Candra rubed at her right arm, stopping just above where the elbo would 
have been as if she feared touching the rounded scar covred stump that 
was there instead. It ached. And today it ached worse than usual. She 
could almost feel her cramped fingers on that right hand. Almost feel 
them and the urge to flex them was almost over powering.
 
She sighed then dropped her left hand to her side. Three days since that 
so called meeting with that Accepted, three days and still no summons 
from any Sedai about her so called rudeness. Again she sighed and this 
time she wondered if she should just pack her things, get rid of the 
white dress and run for    where, where should or could she run to?
 
Finding herself in one of the little corner courtyards with fountains she 
settled down on a bench to watch the water sparkling in the sunshine. 
Should she run or should she just stay and keep trying to work things 
out. Maybe all it would take is to act like poor Matty Lafengill after 
she got kicked in the head by a cow. She smiled all the time. Nodded at 
any one's opinion. Oh and was polite to the extreme.
 
Suddenly she had an odd thought. No one else had complained like the 
Accepted. Maybe it was because all of her classes had included 15 to 20 
others and in that meeting it was just her. Perking up a bit she stood up 
when she heard the bell for the evening meal and joined others along the 
pathway to head back into the building.

Subject Thoughts from the Cook~
Text
For the next few days, Aster's thoughts turn toward the Tower and the 
people in it. Sometimes her thoughts touched on the Accepted she had met, 
other times the gardener and if a smile touched her lips at these time, 
she was unaware of it. And for all of their power, she thought of the 
Sedai least of all. Not many came to 'The Dancing Frog' and the few that 
did seemed so intimidating what with their cool looks and the fierce men 
that accompanied that she usually kept out of their way.
 
Cook noticed Aster's averson and teased her about it one day. "Not all of 
them are like that." she motioned for the young girl to sit next to her. 
"Some are and some arn't. Just like you and Dennia are different. She is 
shy shy shy." this was said with a smile for the cook was not a woman of 
malice. "and you arn't. Remember this. For all of their power, they are 
women like you, like Dennia, like me. So don't judge them all by the 
three or four that you have seen here."
 
Aster nodded then noticing that Cook's cup was low on tea, she picked up 
the pot to add more. "Tell me more, please." she said as she replace the 
tea pot back on it's little tray. "Well," begain Cook. "I have a family 
menber there." she glanced around the kitchen and saw that no one was 
palying attention to Cook and her new assistant' "She is my great, great 
Aunt." Aster put fingers to her lips to hold back a gasp for Cook was 
surely more than in her 50th year of life.
 
Cook patted Aster on her shoulder. "If decide to go there, let me know 
and I'll send her a pie. She loves my apple pie." Cook winked at her new
assistant. "She is a Brown, if you want to know why, ask her. And she 
stays at the library." Cook takes a careful sip of her hot then then 
adds. "usually at the desk."
 
Aster nodded at Cook, eyes showing much interest in this new information. 
"I have a day off in two days' time. I can go then." her words were laced 
with excitment. "I'll leave just after the morning meal and will be glad 
to carry your pie to her."
 
Cook slowly put her cup down. Her lips pursed as she studied Aster. "I'll 
tell you what." she stood up and motioned for Aster to do the same. "I'll 
start your lesson on pie crust now." and begain moveing toward the pastry 
table. "Then if you want, you can carry your pie to my Aunt." Aster's 
eyes got large with that news. "you mean that you think I'm ready for 
that!!"
 
Cook nodded at the younger girl and begain her instructions to lead Aster 
through the time consuming path of making a flakey crust for pies which 
resulted in a flour covered and tired Aster four hours later. Her pie 
crusts were not as flakey as Cooks, but, they were close. Aster stumbled 
to her small bed thinking "I'll work on it ore. Event if I have to work 
all the day tomorrow. I get it right, I -will- get it right."

Candra looked up the hallway, sighed then looked down the hall with 
another sigh. No one around, no one to watch as she fidgeded in front of 
the door that led to the Mistress of Novices office. 'It had to be the 
report from that Accepted.' she thought to herself and almost turned away 
from the door. Almost.
 
Finally she lifted her hand to knock on the slick white surface of the 
door but before she could do that it opened on it's own and a soft voice 
said. "Novice Candra, enter." Well, what else could she do, she entered 
with slow dragging steps.
 
An Hour later she left the office with the Sedai's words ringing in her 
ears. 'Two weeks scrubbing pot... Another class on etiquette... A ten 
page report on following intructions.'
 
Clump, clump, clump echoed along the hall. Sturdy shoes have a way of 
doing that. Along with the fact the person wearing them was feeling like 
death warmed over. Her thoughts rolled with hot anger. "Another class in 
etiquette! Another one!! She had tried to say that she had not had any 
etiquette classes at all, but was told to keep quiet while a Sedai was 
speaking.
 
Clump, clump, clump echoed down the hall, alerting others to her approach 
to a gaggle of other novices. Giggling ones with smirks and peering eyes 
then snickers as she passed them. The Twins were in rare form today with 
their hurtful words. "Hey, Candra, did you get your word to be raised?" 
this followed by loud mocking laughter.
 
She wanted to break into a run. Anything to get out of range of that 
mocking laughter. Instead she squared her shoulders and kept her gaze 
locked on the door at the end of the hall. 'then right...' she kept 
thinking. 'turning right will put them behind me.'
 
Suddnely she found herself in the kitchen where the Mistress of Kitchens 
was holding her shoulder while telling her what to do. As the woman's 
voice droned on and on and on she just nodded and pretended to listen.

Lizbet Egion was born to Harield and Bekka Egion rather late in life. 
There were three other childen, all boys, and all much much older than 
Lizbet.
 
Harield was a wagonere, hiring himself and his wagons out to hawl produce 
from the outlying farms around the Island of Tar Varlon to the docks 
along the river for shipment.
 
 
By the time that Lizbet was 15, her brothers were taking on most of the 
hard work to allow Harield to deal with the records and money side of the 
business.
 
It was when she was 15 that her mother took her to the Tower to be 
tested. And when Lizbet found to have the ability to channel, Bekka was 
both happy and sad. Happy that such a one was from their family and sad 
because of the time she would be away for studies.
 
Lizbet was a dutiful daughter, always doing as she was told and she was 
very happy. Happy to see and learn of things that were not of her humdrum 
life at home. Happy to not being tied to her mothers apron strings and 
overly protected by the male members of her family because she was the 
oly girl, small, delicate and youngest.
 
So when she bid her mother goodby, her tears were mostly of joy.

Zsearin squinted his eyes slightly in concentration as he tried to find the calm his father had tried to teach him. {W See all of your hopes, doubts and frustrations, all emotion and distractions as a flame. Put it all in the flame. Then surround that flame in a Void. Feed it in until all that remains is the Void. {wCalmly, trying to believe he actually felt the emptiness, he lowered the tip of his lance until the length was nearly parallel to the ground. Fixing the butt into the socket, he nodded. He kicked Dancer into a canter and lined her up on the practice target. Leaning forward just a bit, he urged her to a gallop. Tilting his shoulder a fraction then.....WHAM!
      
   The impact was so jarring that for a second he could not see. He felt as if he were spinning around in the saddle and was sure that this time he WOULD fall again. But he didn't, thankfully he didn't. Not this time especially as he could hear mocking laughter behind him to the left. Even over the ringing in his ears.
 
{DOh no. Not this dream again.{w
 
   He knew it was the same persistent nightmare, knew he was reliving painful memories in a dream, even as he felt his body still vibrating. Even as he heard the high-pitched, but cracking, voice of a boy becoming a young man. Even as he nearly cried out in horror when he turned to he who spoke and those with him. Instead of the three boys who had always tormented him, there stood three Trollocs.
 
{DNo. Please. Not that.{w
 
   The pig-snouted Trolloc who had called out to him stuck out a long tongue to lick the blade of his sword. Not the wooden practice blade the boys would have been carrying, but a nasty curved length of steel.
 
"{GHey, Zsearin, come join us for a little sword practice{w". The voice that came from that face was the one from his real memories. But the face wasn't. Nor was the evil chuckle that followed.
 
"{GYou know he doesn't practice sword, Kaevan. Wants to be a Lancer like his dad. Like that would ever happen. And his SPEAR like he's some bloody Aiel{w". This from the hawk-headed one.
 
   The third, another hawk-head, was the biggest of the three. The oldest of the boys, though Zsearin was older than the other two. It cocked its head at him in a most bird-like fashion. But, even though it had a beak and not lips, somehow the sneer was obvious. "{GNow you boys know that the poor little Wasp probably couldn't even LIFT a man's sword. Stop picking on the poor little thing{w", it said in mocking tones. Which caused them all to erupt into open laughter and Zsearin's jaw to clench.
 
   Zsearin whoped around as another voice spoke suddenly right behind him. A very welcome voice.
 
"{GDon't pay any attention to them, Zsearin. You are going to be a great Lancer one day. Maybe Lancer-General even. Order your dad around{w", she said with a warm smile.
 
   Feidra. Beautiful Feidra is how he thought of her. Whenever she smiled at him he felt warmth spread through him like the time he had snuck some {Woosquai{w. And he felt nearly the dizzyness.
 
   {DNo Feidra! RUN! Don't you see!?{w
 
   The scene shifted around the two of them. They were no longer in Ankor Dail, but on a trail headed back there. Headed back with both their families after going to meet traders who had just come out of the Waste. The path ran alongside a dense forest. Although it was not night yet, it was nearly as dark. A thunderstorm, rare in Shienar, had built up while they we visiting the traders. They hoped to get  home before it broke.
 
   But luck did not hold. The clouds broke and rain pounded down in a torrential torrent. So heavy you could no longer see the tree-line of the forest. Could barely see more than a couple of paces away.
 
   That is why they didn't see the band of Trollocs boiling out of the woods and coming right at them. Taken by surprise, they never had a chance.
 
   {DNo...NO! NO!  {wZsearin struggles to awaken.
 
   He couldn't see her, somewhere in the pitch black he heard Feidra scream. There was other screaming and shouting, braying of terrified horses and clashes of steel. But he heard her voice above all else. And ran toward her.
 
   Just ahead, he could see a Trolloc struggling to drag someone along with it. Not Feidra. Someone smaller. His brother, Mykael.
 
  He had no weapon. Outrage, and fear swelled into panic inside him. And as they did, something else did too.

He felt as if he were freezing in the deepest snow, and at the same time burning as if he were standing in a campfire. And nauseous. Sicker than the time he had snacked on the wrong berries in the woods.
 
   He fought it. Struggled to get control of himself. Control of the raging current that sought to extinguish him. He reached for the Void and this time obviously succeeded. He pushed the pain, nausea, and fear away. It was somehow distant now, as if it belonged to someone else. Anger flickered redly on the outside of Void. His senses were all sharper he noticed. Just then the Trolloc smashed Mykael with the butt of his sword. The blow landed on the side of his head with a wet smack.
 
   Zsearin raised his hand toward the Trolloc and....
 
{DNO!NO!NO!!NONONONO!!!{w
 
   Finally he pulled himself awake. Sweating and screaming, but awake. Fortunatly, no one was around to hear his screams. Shakingly, he sat up and began to get ready to continue his journey. He tried to put thoughts of the nightmare and the memories that caused it behind him.
 
   Among those in the group with him that terrible day, Feidra was among the few never accounted for. Most of them women, and a couple of children. Not that he held out any hope. He had been raised on stories of what happened to those that the Trollocs captured. But still, there was the words of the Crone...
 
   The men that found him assumed he must have been overlooked in the storm after hitting his head. And they even believed that all the evidence they saw of burning must have been due to lightning. But Zsearin knew the truth. And after returning home, he gathered up a few of his things and rode Dancer to Fal Moran. He left her there with a friend of his father's. Zsearin then took his spear and little else and set out for Tarwin's Gap. He intended to cross into the Blight and die fighting as did Aiel men who learned they could channel. And that indeed would have been his fate if not for the Crone.
 
   As he mounted Dancer and resumed his journey to Caemlyn, there were two things he could not stop thinking about. The first was the words of the Crone, that had put him on this journey.
 
   "{CWhen the Wasp has passed the White Flame and to the maw of the Lion came. Then will he stand the Trial of the Black. There will he be marked. Rise in Light or fall in Dark. With lost Love found he may be saved. Grace or Doom on the edge of a blade. On one path shame can lead to Honor and will he in the Last Battle stand.{w"
 
   He really didn't understand much of it. But if there was a chance that Feidra still lived, he had to know. As to anything else, well....what is is what is. Or, as one Aes Sedai he had seen as a boy had said, the Wheel weaves as it will.
 
   The other thing always came at the end of the nightmare, which he had avoided this time. But the voice haunted him anyway. A huge voice, dripping with malevolence. Maybe the voice of the Dark One himself. It only ever said one word, but that was more than enough.
