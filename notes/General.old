I believe whirlwind needs looked into.  While trying to target one person
(mob) in a room I.  E.  Whirl Hulking, it sucked a player into the fight,
which I am in the understanding that is what the command Whirl All is
supposed to do.  

Thanks

An unfortunate side affect.  I'll look into it, but it may be a while
until i can fix it.  Was that person in your group or were they just
wandering around?  Does it pull in other mobs too?

Subject Hoarding exp.~
Text
Just an FYI!  When you kill a mob, the game gives you exp based on your
current level, plus your hoarded exp divided by 2000.  

So if you are level 90 with 900k exp, its not going to give you the exp for
being level 90, its going to give you the experience as if you are level
540.  

Right now the only benefit to hoarding exp is to save it up for when your
masterform is higher so that it raises it :) 
 
Thanks!

would like to make an alt that is a channie, then buy all the weaves
that the alt can so I can do a cost command.
 
mind crush           0 A,   0 E,   0 F, 110 S,   0 W,   100 End.
 
then make a list to post on the perm board. This way channies will
not buy weaves they can't cast and get stuck with them.
Is that an ok thing to do???

I need anyone who took the create angreal talent before I took it out
(which was one day after pwipe) to contact me so we can switch it out with
another talent.  I will move trains from one skill to the other if you come
back to me in the next 3 days.  After that, I will go into the pfile to
remove it.  

I apologize, but right now it does not fit into the timeline.  If it is
unlocked in the future I will put it back into character creation.  
 
I will also switch it out for a merit or remove a flaw.
 
Thank you!

I am working to add fun and exciting new things to the code, but while
I'm working on that, I would like for you to let me know of any typos or
grammar problems you see in the skill or weave messages.  I'm not looking
for spelling issues on mobs or in rooms but on the damage messages or
effects that you see when using skills or weaves.  

The more you point out in a note under Bugs, the more I can get cleaned up.

Subject Color -- your feedback is welcome!~
Text
In the beginning, there was telnet and it was monochrome and we called it
good because monochrome ruled the land and was all that we knew.  But then
IBM created color.  Who cared that it was 8-bit and there were only 16
colors?  It was bright and shiny and there was much rejoicing in the land...
Until we looked at our MUDs and their monochrome existences.  After much
gnashing of teeth, Lope brought color to our MUD code and things were once
again bright and shiny.  But CGA was followed by XGA and VGA and 1080i and
our heads were all spinning with the possibilities and the colors and the
excitement.  And then we looked at our MUDs and their 16 colors.  

But do not despair, gentle beings!  For long ago, the ability to SEE more
than the colors of the rainbow was coded into your MUD clients!  Zugg and
others foresaw the future and built the capability into their programs and
the future is NOW!  

What does this mean for you, gentle reader?  If you are using a modern MUD
client, like zMUD, cMUD, MUSHClient, or anything released after the
millenium, all you need do is tell the client that you, too, want to see
things in hi-def!  How do you do this?  That depends on which client you're
using.  For most, it is as simple as checking a box to allow remote MXP, but
that will be up to you, gentle reader, to discover.

Text
I've rp'ed with Raesan, then later with Saurison in
the little town of Osenrein where Aster has an ic job
in the Dancing Frog as cooks helper and all around
dish and bottle washer.
 
During the rp's with Raesan, I requested and received
an ok from Immortal to spread a rumor that a man channie
had been taken by the Reds and placed in the Tower.
 
Now in rp with Saurison that rumor has come up and with
Aster having a reason to go across the bridge, I would
like to have permission and info from the imms to gain
knowledge, rumors or otherwise about that male channie
the Reds have and possibly other stuff for interesting
continuing rp as well.
 
I'm pretty sure that when Raesan's busy RL settles down
that he would jump into that string of rp as well.
 
Thanks, and waiting eagerly for what you have in store
for us. :)
 
PS. oh oh, forgot that Asters boss, the cook in the pub
has a Great-great-great-ect Aunt that is a Brown Sedai
who hangs out in the Library and loves apple pie.
 
thanks again.
