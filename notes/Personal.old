Hey Bry,
 
Had a newbiehelper validate a player who had a pretty bad appearance today, but gave the "reasoning" that it makes people mad when they correct other peoples appearances.
 
I'll email the text of our discussion, but I think we should update the help file to give them the flexibility to actually enforce grammar.
 
Jomissa is also requesting removing the NH title, i'll leave that to you.
 
Thanks,
James

wanted your opinion on the past arch.
 
Stepping through the opening she was surprised.
There was joy in the air, brightness, color and
a world filled with the sweet odor of flowers.
The sweet smell was so strong that she sneezed
and only then noticed the wedding bouquets she
was holding. "wedding?"
 
A man was standing next to her. Handsome, tall
and she felt a surge of love for him that made
her hear flutter. But wait, he was arguing with
a tall stately woman who was wearing the ring of
an Aes Sedai. "Terrance." she whispered and felt
another flutter of love for him as she slipped
her small hand into his.
 
His fingers closed around hers and she now begain
to pay attention to what was being said. "She is
to be my Wife, the mother of my children. Not one
of your mindless girls in white!" He was almost
shouting at the Aes Sedai. "NO NO NO. I WILL NOT
ALLOW IT!"
 
And now he was shouting. The Aes Sedai never lost
her outer calmness, even when she responded. "I
think that is a decision that is for Miss Egion.
Don't you." and both turned to look at Lizbet.
 
Things begain to go slightly blurry around the 
edges now. She gave Terrances' hand a squeeze all
the while saying softly. "I love you... really I do.
But." The look of pain on his face almost made her
miss the sight of the opening that she was to use
to return by.. almost but there had been still time
enough for her to return in spite of the pain that 
an lost love leaves in a woman's heart.
