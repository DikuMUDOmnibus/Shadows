Text
Walter Deering and Ouiso Deering became parents. A girl named 
Candra. Of course he wanted a boy and she never got to know 
her father much before he was killed in an accident when she 
was three.
 
When she was 5 there was danger, much danger from invading 
Aiel and her mother attempted to take her up river toward the 
White Tower for safety. And if it was not for a frayed rope 
that sent several hundred pounds of cargo crashing to the 
docks, Ouiso might have done that.
 
Now Candra was an orphan with her mother just being killed 
and she was crippled by losing her right arm just above the 
elbo. Double stikes against her. The only good luck came from 
a Sedai of the Yellow Ajah taking passage on the ship. She 
took the injured child in hand to heal and carry her north.
 
She was placed with a caring family with the Sedai keeping in 
touch, even visiting on occasion. Ten years and suddenly the 
Sedai told Candra that she was Tower material and that she 
would escort the young woman there to be tested.
 
The results was good news, well to the Sedai it was, and 
Candra now wears the white dress of a Novice.

Subject A class on the grass~
Text
The girls, well young women, who had gathered for their class were 
delighted when the Sedai teaching it, told them they would be taking 
that class outside. So giggling, cattering and whispering they trailed 
along after the Sedai as she led the way outside to the eastern side of 
the tower.
 
Following a stone path they suddenly turned off through an opening in 
the tall thick hedges and what they found was a large flat clearing... 
totally suroundded by the same hedge. It made a tall solid wall round 
the area, a place of soft green rass and when the Sedai told them to 
sit, they found the grass was soft and comfortable.
 
Ah, but no where to look except at the green wall of the hedge, the 
sky, the Sedai and the other novices. The first rush of cheerfullness 
when they found out the class would be outside, soon sagwayed into 
boredem.
 
As the class progressed the Sedai's words soon blurred into a blaugh 
blaugh sound. Suddenly she clapped her hands and everyone jumped and 
if she was amused she never showed that emotion.. well her eyes did 
sparkle slightly, remembering her own youth and times as a novice.
 
She clapped her hands again. "All right girls, cup your hands we will 
now practice with drawing a -small- amount of sadar for a cold light." 
With that announcemnt there was a shifting along the ranks with each 
novic settling into a sitting positon that was more comfortable for 
practicing weaves. Some went to thier knees and sat back on their 
heels, others curled their legs to the side and a few crossing their 
legs under heavy white skirts.
 
The Sedia watched then nodded with approval at such quick response from 
the young women. "now cup your hands..." sudednly she was interupped by 
tittering then giggling. Her gaze located then centered on 3 novices 
that were elbowing and snickering at Candra cuping her left hand. Her 
Face was red but the anger she felt did not show on her face.
 
The Sedai teaching the class took 2 steps closer to the girls, narrowed 
her eyes and put a sleep weave on all three. "My my." she said softly 
as she dusted her hands. "Three sleeping during class. I think that 
might be a day in the kitchen scrubbing pots." ... "now, embrace...." 
and the class contiued much to the delight of Candra and others in the 
class that had suffered from the bullying threesome.

Sorry, isn't happening :( You can be put up to accepted IF you write a
backstory and a story about the rings, but that is it.  

If you are an accepted and want to move to aes sedai, you will need a
mixture of notes and RP.  Since this is the beginning of the turn and there
are no Aes Sedai, if you do a total of 8 notes, 3 paragraphs long (at least)
then we will raise you.  If you would like to also RP instead of doing
notes, please contact an Imm.  One 30 minute RP session counts as one 'note'
towards your progression to Aes Sedai.  
 
If you have any questions please contact me or Blackwind.

Subject White Tower Entrance Reqs - FCs~
Text
As previously stated, there will be no instant Aes Sedai characters at
the moment.  

If you want to make a Novice, you need the following: the embrace skill
(obviously), a minimum eight-line description and a note detailing the
character's background.  Once you have that, you can contact someone who is
Accepted or Aes Sedai within the Tower to do entrance RP (getting tested and
the like).  If there is no one available, Fire or myself could have a
faceless character do the RP with you.  

If you want to start as an Accepted, you will need, in addition to the above
requirements, a note detailing your Raising (passing through the Three
Arches) that is to be sent to the immortal staff for approval.  In addition,
you will be required to demonstrate knowledge of Tower and student life so
that we know you can RP teaching classes to Novices and the like.  

If you are currently a Novice and wish to become an Accepted, you need a
total of six RPs (of at least thirty minutes) or stories (of at least three
paragraphs), and two of these requirements must be fulfilled by RPs. 
However, the background note and your RP to get into the Tower is included
in this total.  Once you have met the requirements, send a note detailing
your Raising to the immortal staff for approval (just as in the requirement
for starting as an Accepted).  

If you are currently an Accepted and wish to become Aes Sedai, you need a
total of seven RPs (of at least thirty minutes) or stories (of at least three
paragraphs), and three of these requirements must be fulfilled by RPs.  The
note created for the Raising counts toward the requirements.  Once you have
met the requirements, send a note detailing your Raising to Sedai (the
hundred weaves, though only the first, last and one of the middle weaves
need to be detailed in the story) to the immortal staff for approval.  

If there are any questions, please contact me or Firesong.

Vira sighs softly, before nodding to the Aes Sedai.  "{GI'll tell you, we

pauses before continuing, "{GMy mother was a commoner, a seamstress.  Her

(I'm hoping this is ok for a lesson)
 
Classes and chores. Classes and chores. Not so
much studying at first. Then the history classes
started and the hours of studying increased by
hours. Well for some of them. Lizbet and and few
other Novices seemed to learn slower than others.
On the other band there were a few Novices that
seemed to remember everything they heard and read.
 
The Sedai teaching this class arranged the girls
in a large circle around her then told them to
sit and place their candle on the floor next to
them. Lizbet glanced around then felt her cheeks
heating as they flamed red. All the others had
brought holders for the candles.... all but her. 
Oh well.
 
Alyce Sedai clapped her hands twice to call the
class to order "Today girls, we will practice a
weave." Lizbet bit her lower lip to keep from
yelling with glee. One of the other girls clapped
her hands to her own mouth but her eyes were wide
with excitment. The other three murmured softly
to each other in their excitment, but all in all 
the class maintained it's order.
 
Alyce Sedai continued. "This is one step further
than what you have learned in your embracing class."
Then she went on to explain about the five spheres
that made up saidan. They all knew this but it was
explained again anyway. Lizbet had noticed that a
lot of things were done that way to make sure the
novices knew and remembered what was needed.

Today they would use the sphere of fire to light
their candles. It was a simple weave and only used
a small bit of the sphere. Still the girls were
all excited to actually do something beside the 
embrace and release they usually did for two hours
each day.
 
Then it begain with embracing, slecting threads of
fire to touch the top of the wick of their candle.
It was slow going at first. Some not lighting, some
dropping the candle, some releasing too soon, and
one candle not lighting at all that first half hour.
 
By the end of the class, each girl was exhausted but
happy with their progress, as was Alyce Sedai. "Now."
she said firmly. "I don't want to hear of any of you
showing off. I don't want to hear of any candles lit
by any of you... unless someone, and I do mean, Sedai
or teaching Accepted are with you."
 
And yet another lesson that was taught over and over.
Never embrace at all unless with supervision. And
after hearing about the Novice that burned out, all
of them could understand the repitition of that one.

Stepping through the opening she was surprised.
There was joy in the air, brightness, color and
a world filled with the sweet odor of flowers.
The sweet smell was so strong that she sneezed
and only then noticed the wedding bouquets she
was holding. "wedding?"
 
A man was standing next to her. Handsome, tall
and she felt a surge of love for him that made
her hear flutter. But wait, he was arguing with
a tall stately woman who was wearing the ring of
an Aes Sedai. "Terrance." she whispered and felt
another flutter of love for him as she slipped
her small hand into his.
 
His fingers closed around hers and she now begain
to pay attention to what was being said. "She is
to be my Wife, the mother of my children. Not one
of your mindless girls in white!" He was almost
shouting at the Aes Sedai. "NO NO NO. I WILL NOT
ALLOW IT!"
 
And now he was shouting. The Aes Sedai never lost
her outer calmness, even when she responded. "I
think that is a decision that is for Miss Egion.
Don't you." and both turned to look at Lizbet.
 
Things begain to go slightly blurry around the 
edges now. She gave Terrances' hand a squeeze all
the while saying softly. "I love you... really I do.
But." The look of pain on his face almost made her
miss the sight of the opening that she was to use
to return by.. almost but there had been still time
enough for her to return in spite of the pain that 
an lost love leaves in a woman's heart.

Lizbet found herself in the White Tower gardens
where she was surrounded by the sights of birds
and the sounds of their calls. Sunlight warmed
her shoulders and the wind brought bright falling
leaves floating over the foundtan to land and
dance in a whirl around her feet.
 
The sound of footsteps had her turning around to
see a tall handsome man approaching her. Terrance!
with the sight of him sending her heart fluttering
in her chest. She quickly glanced around to see if
anyone of the White Tower saw him there. No one.
 
Lifting a hand toward him, she called out softly.
"You shouldn't be here. I'm still a novice. Not
allowed to be around men." the worry in her voice
had him hurrying forward to catch up her hand in
his. "I've come to take you back home where you
belong." he kissed the back of her hand. "With me."
 
She tried to pull her hand back while thoughts
moved through her mind like a tornado. (I know what
is need to keep me from dying. I know enough to keep
controll. I can make things happen to be kicked out)
"You still want to marry me?"
 
Just before he kissed her lips, she saw the opening
that would take her back. It would take her from him
that she loved beyon anything she knew. But.. there
was something else that she loved as much or more and
thoughts of all kinds of knowledge she would miss if 
she stayed with him.
 
Suddenly without another thought she had pulled away
from him and was hurrying toward the portal back,
Trying to make it in time before it winked out.

This time she stepped into darkness. Darkness and cold.
Lizbet became still for a while, listening hard to the
silence. A silence made even more quiet by a soft falling
snow. As her eyes grew used to the dark, she begain to
notice a low orange flicker to her left. Turning that
way she moved slowly to the promise of heat and company
of others.
 
Then she almost screamed when a hand touched her shoulder
"Liz... Sedai. Why did you stop." turning to face the one
talking to her. "No reason. Just enjoying the sight of 
the fire and others around it." in an instant she knew him.
Tarrance. It was he and he belonged to her. She could feel
him nestled there in her mind. Her Gaiden.
 
A quick smile "Just enjoyig the quietness too." they were
on a mission with the others they traveled with. A mission
to bring healing to a border village that had been attacked
and almost destroyed before those minions of Darkness were
driven back. How much more could she ask. Full Sedai with
the ring gleaming on her finger.
 
She glanced up at her Gaiden, and Tarrance her bonded.
Joy filled her, nothing else could be so full filling.
Serving as a healer, Having Tarrance as her Gaiden. He
touched her cheek with the back of his fingers. "Cold."
Not a question, he had the ability now to know that. So
he motioned her toward the fire where two others sat with
cups of hot soup in hand.
 
She was about to take that step forward. One step would
take her to light. Another to hearing and speaking with
the others. Another step or two after that would take her
to warmth then two more to food. Yet she paused. Paused
to turn back and look behind her to see what was humming
there.
 
The portal! Why now, why? She stood frozen, Not moving
in either direction while she stared at the portal. Why?
His voice called out to her. "Lizbet Sedai. Come and sit.
There is hot tea and soup to warm you." Still she couldn't
move. It was only when the humming slowed to a stop that
she finally broke free. And ran as hard as she could. Not
toward the fire. Not toward warmth and food. Not toward
her Gaiden. But to the portal where she made a dive though
it a second before it vanished.

Tucking a lock of hair back behind an ear, Vira furrows her brow in
concentration at the task before her.  Three other Accepted around her were
weaving threads of Spirit and Fire in terrifying illusions, while another
one was weaving flows of Air and pinching Vira, all in an attempt to grab
Vira's attention as she weaved the final, 100th weave.  Vira moans in
rapture as another Accepted, under the guidance of a Yellow, heals her of
the wounds that were given to her during this round of training.  

It was the first time that Vira had completed all 100 weaves without a
break.  "{GThank you, Nyda Sedai, Accepted.  {x" She then stretches as the other
Accepted titter and chat, congratulating her before they leave, leaving only
Nyda Sedai.  Nyda gives her an impressed look, "{YAccepted Vira, you are doing
well, considering you haven't been an Accepted for long.  Keep up the good
work.  {x" The homely Aes Sedai gives her a smile before walking out the door.



Vira watches the Aes Sedai as she leaves, then brushes invisible dust off of
her dress self-consciously.  Compliments from Aes Sedai were always edged-
she now knew they were watching her closely, and expected perfection out of
her.  

"{GWell...  {x" Vira thinks to herself as she walks out of the room, towards her
chambers upstairs, arriving to her room in short order.  "{GIf perfection is
what they want, then perfection is what they will get.  {x" She smiles to

Vira walked with purpose down the cobblestone street, her feet chilled by
the cold stone.  Her destination was in the city center, where she could see
the large, six-pointed star.  Around the city center stood men in dark
uniforms, wielding yew bows, strings taut and pulled to their cheeks, with
poison-tipped, barbed arrows held back.  Audible are the cries of more men
behind her, and from the sounds, gaining quickly.  Her stride never falters,
and as she steps onto the star and begins to weave, the archers release
their arrows, which are deflected by a dome of air.  The men rushing toward
her from behind are stopped short with a tall wall of fire.  She completes
the weave, which releases a blinding flash, forcing the men to shield their
eyes.  

Heat singes Vira's skin as she walks up the mountain, the obsidian scattered
across the ground slicing into her unshod feet.  As she continues, the
mountain beneath her shakes, rumbles in warning.  Large boulders fall from
the peak, rushing down, nearly hitting Vira as she continues to climb.  The
last, and largest, boulder rolls down at her, completely unavoidable.  Vira
steps into the circle, and begins weaving the required weave- which heats up
the air around her even more.  She splits her flows, using a bit of air to
create a wall which, instead of stopping the boulder, creates a ramp which
makes it fly above and past her.  

Cold rain slaps against Vira's skin as she walks toward the pond in the
clearing at the White Tower.  Floating atop the pond is a short, red haired
woman wearing what looks to be an Accepted dress.  As Vira nears, she can
tell it was who she dreaded- Iero.  She steps into the circle and begins to
weave what is required, immediately splitting the flows and using air to
lift Iero out of the water, onto the ground.  Small bursts of air force the
water out of her lungs, but, unable to leave the circle, Vira can do
nothing.  Just as she is about to finish her final weave, Caliam runs into
the area, collapsing on the ground near Iero.  He begins to resuscitate her,
but fails.  Standing up, he turns to Vira, who is still working on the
weave, "{GIf you cared more about Iero than your damned self, she would be
alive!  {x" Drawing his sword, he runs at Vira to strike her, only to trip and
fall to the ground due to a weave of air that Vira placed.  His sword goes
flying, but he drags himself toward Vira, managing to get a hand on her
ankle.  Vira finishes her weave, but is unable to leave, and Caliam draws a
dagger out from a sheath on his waist and stabs Vira in the calf.  

As soon as the dagger sinks into Vira's calf, he is thrown back with a blast
of air, striking a tree, before slumping down to the ground, unmoving.  Vira
removes the dagger, then moves on.

Subject Report of a possible male channeler in Newbie School~
Text
{cAes Sedai{x,

Today a man approached me here in Newbie School.

He was requesting to be trained in the One Power.

His appearance was something like this:
A short man with a topknot.

The danger of letting a male channeler walk free is something
history has told us too much about. My duty as the WhiteTower
eyes and ears have been served once more.

Please make sure this man is handled.

Signed by the hand of the {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x Trainer,
Newbie School
~
