Alice sat by the fire and looked sideways at her travelling companion. The older man, Hitsuo he said was his name, didn't seem to notice her. She knew better than to believe that act. 

She had met the Borderlander three days ago, trying to spy on a group of Whitecloaks. He noticed her when she got too close and walked her to his camp. Like that could have been called a camp.

Text
We thoroughly encourage roleplaying here at Age Of Illusion, and to
further that, we will reward roleplaying that is sent to us in a log file. 
Either put the RP in a note sent to Bryan or myself or email a log of the RP
to bryan.hamann@gmail.com.  This could be as simple as two people
meeting in a bar or even IC training for your mastery skill.  

Be creative!  You can often find some reason to chat for a brief time at the
very least, and more roleplay is a good thing for the MUD.

Subject EQ list (Brief)~
Text
I thought I'd chime in and add a bit more about the L90 eq that's
available.  

When you first get to 90 and especially if you don't have help, there's
nearly a full set of low-end L90 gear available from Moe in Mayene.  This
stuff can be a great start and a bridge to the other gear.  

Light: Altaran Lamp, shop in Malden 
Channie Ring:  Heir, Maradon Palace
On Back:  Tri-Color Cloak, traffic monitor in Aringill
Over Face:  Trolloc Snout, stash in the Ways

A couple weapons to find:
Sword:  Blade from Malkier Fade, cutlass from Falme Boat Captain
Dagger:  Jeweled dagger in stash in Shaido, need keys hidden in the area
Staff:  Wanderers in the Forest
Spear: Random spawn on a Defender in the Stone
Bow:  Stash in the Forest

There are much harder weapons to find as well, up there with the Red Ajah rings:
Sword:  Quest in Mayene
Dagger:  Stash in Osenrein
Arrows:  Defenders of the Stone in Tear...usually the hard way

Subject Insta-Sedai's this turn.

Sorry, isn't happening :( You can be put up to Accepted IF you write a
backstory and a story about the rings, but that is it.  

If you are an Accepted and want to move to Aes Sedai, you will need a
mixture of notes and RP.  Since this is the beginning of the turn and there
are no Aes Sedai, if you do a total of 8 notes, 3 paragraphs long (at least)
then we will raise you.  If you would like to also RP instead of doing
notes, please contact an Imm.  One 30 minute RP session counts as one 'note'
towards your progression to Aes Sedai.  

If you have any questions please contact me or Darkwind.

Thanks!

Subject White Tower Entrance Reqs - FCs-
Text

As previously stated, there will be no instant Aes Sedai characters at
the moment.  

If you want to make a Novice, you need the following: the embrace skill
(obviously), a minimum eight-line description and a note detailing the
character's background.  Once you have that, you can contact someone who is
Accepted or Aes Sedai within the Tower to do entrance RP (getting tested and
the like).  If there is no one available, Fire or myself could have a
faceless character do the RP with you.  

If you want to start as an Accepted, you will need, in addition to the above
requirements, a note detailing your Raising (passing through the Three
Arches) that is to be sent to the immortal staff for approval.  In addition,
you will be required to demonstrate knowledge of Tower and student life so
that we know you can RP teaching classes to Novices and the like.  
If you are currently a Novice and wish to become an Accepted, you need a
total of six RPs (of at least thirty minutes) or stories (of at least three
paragraphs), and two of these requirements must be fulfilled by RPs. 

However, the background note and your RP to get into the Tower is included
in this total.  Once you have met the requirements, send a note detailing
your Raising to the immortal staff for approval (just as in the requirement
for starting as an Accepted).  

If you are currently an Accepted and wish to become Aes Sedai, you need a
total of seven RPs (of at least thirty minutes) or stories (of at least three
paragraphs), and three of these requirements must be fulfilled by RPs.  The
note created for the Raising counts toward the requirements.  Once you have
met the requirements, send a note detailing your Raising to Sedai (the
hundred weaves, though only the first, last and one of the middle weaves
need to be detailed in the story) to the immortal staff for approval.  
If there are any questions, please contact me or Firesong.
