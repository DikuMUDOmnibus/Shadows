Subject Grid wide rp idea~
Text
Valen pushed me to explore my idea of a large
bounty/reward to find someone. So here is the
brain fart I've come up with.
>
One of the countries has a dying ruler. Even
the most talented Yellow Sedai can't help to
keep this ruler (male/female) alive and since
this Ruler has no surving heirs a search has
been made. Advisors and Rolyal Arcivest have
found two names of possible candidates. But
have no idea where they are. Only the race &
age and sex of that person.
>
And now after their own people failing in the
search, they have sent out runners with news
of a reward... or maybe that just leaked out
and has spread across the WoT world to other
countries so that there is now a mad scramble
to find these two people.
 
and as always there well be those that are only
pretenders, some that actually think they are
the right heir but arn't and the two that are
the real Heirs. 
>
Finally if it comes to the actuall finding of
the real Heirs (there should be Imm hints from
time to time) Which Heir gets the throne. Will
the country split on that decision, will one
have the backing of the court and the other one
challengess it with a rebel folllowing...??
>
hople you like this.

The healing herbs don't heal...  Despite having a level 90 heal listed
for them.  

If you get a chance to look into why this stopped working, that would be
sweet.

Subject An Old Skill~

I was just thinking (Yes, I live dangerously like that) and old skill
that was pretty fun to use waaaay back in the day was shadow.  For those
that don't remember it was the super-secret way of "following" someone
without them being aware of it.  Granted with the newer setup now, I think
their level of awareness of you shadowing them would play on your sneak and
shadow abilities, and their observation and awareness.  Annnnnnnyway just
throwing that out for some consideration.

Subject Easy one~
Text
Ok this one is easy, possibly even fixable by Frost the builder, with a
couple of mobprogs but its something that was the point of a few discussions
over mudconnect, when I was trying to bring in new characters to the last
incarnation.  

I'm speaking of..  Hp and Endur.  As it stands, we're accustomed to it but
if say no one is on or they were idle there were many of times that new
players would get pissed and usually not come back, when they figured out...
They didn't train up their HP and Endur, EARLY.  Its one of those easy over
sites that people usually forget about but can be extremely aggregating to
new people, in what i've seen and opinion.  Easy fix would be the mobprogs,
telling every new character..  To train to your max hp and endur, as soon as
possible.  Or..  Well, adjusting the code would of course be the hard way. 



This of course entirely depends on if you guys were wanting to bring in a
bunch of new blood :) but yea.  (For our neigherhood builder, the new to
mudding texts...  Needs updated and yea perhaps some friendly reminders
added to the school, like the Hp thing)

Figured Id start small.  Code stuff..  I'll get later, need to test a couple
of things

Subject Lot harder one~
Text
Fire said..  He wanted to make sure the classes were balanced and fair
for everyone.  I thought they were...  First let me address, the end all
*required* skill..  Ambidextrous.  I even recreated to take the skill and if
I do that, thats bad.  Lol.  Its just that I HAD to because everyone else
took it.  Ambi isn't TOO dangerous in the hands of a channie.  Puts them on
par with the power potential with theif's now (since thiefs...  Used to not
hit that hard...  Until someone added a stupid, Vampiric dagger..  That does
more damage that the mastery weapon..  Why??  I'll get to this in a sec) But
an Ambi warrior, with 130 or so in second-fifth attack and 100+
blademaster..  Is devastating.  

Now of course, most of this applies to PC combat.  If you want to pull away
from that..  Well a mud might be a little off..  Perhaps mush?  Lol, we
still have to back things up with code so.  Anyway.  With ambi on a
warrior..  You can average 8 attacks per round..  With high blademaster that
can go to 16 to 20 plus attacks per round easily...  And old channeler with
harm at 300, couldn't compete with the character class that is designed to
destroy in physical combat (and the tendency of everyone to set HIGH str on
warriors) 

In most games I've ever played..  Pen and paper, mud, online rpg..  Ect. 
Every game that has had this ability *massive sword work with two blades*
they usually balanced it..  In one of three ways (and I don't think I really
see that with this one, which is why the note, maybe you can see it in the
code) 1.  You have less defense and thus sacrifice taking more damage, for
being able to deal more.  2.  Its harder to consistently hit with all your
attacks and easier to parry while wearing a sword and shield.  Or 3.  You
didn't gain more hits..  You just gained increased damage, equal to half the
damage potential of your off-hand weapon.  

While prehaps the most logical..  A few of those.  There, I suppose would
also be the thing of..  Warriors don't need enurance, they don't really use
it.  If they are going to expel (or any class I suppose, would suck for
extreamly strong channies..  Lol) large amounts of strength into their
swings, that would use ALOT of endurance;) And well, if you were swinging
two swords (how you could be a double blademaster still bugs me but hey, its
a game) it would seem like it would be terribly taxing.  Meaning you got
enough for 1 REAL GOOD fight, if it lasted say..  30 rounds or more. 
*shrug* no clue what to do about it actually.  Let you use a shield.. 
Without ambi, and still fire master forms?  *shrug*

Ok, I'll stop for the night after this one.  On balance issue again.. 
Its cool their stronger weaves..  But if a thief or warrior hits a channeler
first, channeler is dead..  Almost guarentee (would need a thief to test
that with but warriors I know.)  I know there is a way to counter this
skill..  But.  Taking a Thief.  Always thought there were designed to dash
around, flee, assissinate and backstab things.  Quick, silent and deadly. 
Channelers, have to set up their target.  Got to see them first and hit them
with wrap, levitate, blind..  Ect..  Ect (alot of typing involved in being a
channie or thief..)  

But how do you stop either one?  Be a warrior, with the attacks and ambi.. 
Sneak in, trip once and then use throw.  Throw still keeps the target from
using ANY commands while its active.  For like 8 seconds.  3 rounds.  It
stays in active for anyone..  For like 6 or 7 seconds.  I'm meaning, if I
hit you with throw, I can hit you with another..  Before you can recover. 
The delay in commands, stops you from fleeing, channeling, tripping.. 
ANYTHING.  You can not enter Any commands.  Leaving it a complelty physical
fight and 90% of the time, warrior wins (if he took the time to build his
character) 

This should be..  Looked at maybe?  Lol.  Anyway..  I'll stop for now. 
There are a lot of these things..  Little niche's in the code.  If I had my
compatriot Keron here, I could probley form all of them together better. 
Anyway..  It just struck me..  As off when whirl and circle and other skills
were tossed back in.  There was a reason, I thought, Zandor pulled them for
a reason.  It just struck me as balance and been lost..  BADLY.  I'm sure
I'll write more..  Next week?  Lol *shrug* o/

Raesan and I have been rp'ing when we can and on our last rp we came up 
with a rumor that an npc Male Channie had been taken by Red Sedai and
is now locked up in the Tower. The rumor goes that 12 Sedai along with
a number of Gaiden were seen disembarking a boat with the men/gaiden
carrying a coffin from the peir toward the Tower. Is this ok to be put
on the Rumor mill?
