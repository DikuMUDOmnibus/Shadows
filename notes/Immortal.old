It makes it so that when someone uses a fire weave on you, your equipment
doesnt damage you and fall off.  Most of the high level equipment is already
fireproof, you can check by loring or identifying the object.  :)

Alrighty, thanks again for the multiple masterforms, its great!  But its
probably is what mode this prominent.  Is there a decent level 90 whip in
game?  The quest is great and by rumor the WM one is too but, until that
time I'm not sure what to do.  Not looking for the Lanfear blade of the whip
world but a decent 90 would be cool.  If its in the game, just say so..  And
I suppose I'll start hunting.

Hey, not to bark and bite..  But I still forward the idea of a builders

here..  Hurts.  The people I brought back, Fiaran and Vandi (still working
on others) started to say how much it sucks that we're crashing.  Anyway.. 
If its a matter of resources or something..  I don't mind a bit to help pay
for extra server side or something, or the whole shebang in a month or so. 
Just wanted to forward this to ya.  I've coded a bit in C++ its rough.  You
miss something and things go boom, tis why I can't stand it, it keeps me up
at night :P But yea, just saying we love that you opened the place up and if
you need anything to make things a bit easier on you..  Just yell, we can

Anywhom, thanks again man for the mud.  And Good luck.

I petition to have the colors of the guild ranks in the Towerguard

Don't remember though)

Subject Question~
Text
Heya, I do have a feeling Firesong is very busy..  And the rest?? 
*shrug* No clue, have had a serious problem reaching one but that's neither
here nor then.  The question was, With Firesong, being so evidently busy and
apparently the torch of sloughing through the code has fallen to you, would
you mind if I sent you another note sometime or perhaps a combination of
notes outlining some thoughts, idea's and even complaints?  Not about anyone
but about whats in the game and the way the code works or doesn't work.. 
From a perspective from down here?  

If I am correct in assuming, like fire said he acquired the whole code of
the previous owners just had to get rid of the extra added stuff.  They in
turn, got it from Zandor, the creator based on older designs and as far as I
remember the code there was still intact just there were missing area's that
had to be recovered vnums and what nots.  So yea, basically the code base.. 
Combat, skills and the rest should be fairly the same as it was when "The
Shadow Wars"..  SO yea, I gots lots of..  Idea's.  And I would probably hate
myself and end up driving myself insane if I didn't say SOMETHING.  Take it
or leave it.  If you take the other note..  Well, I don't wanna response;)
just give you some more things to think about if your interested.

Caliam hit the jackpot and rolled a blademaster % increase while
leveling.  The bad news, it put the skill to 95.  Ichi of course didn't care
how the skill got to 95%, he simply was not going to train Caliam any
further.  I set Caliam's bm back to 94, he trained but did not get the
heron.  So I gave Caliam the heron and added back the skill % I had removed.
Crisis averted.

The guild flags have been coded in and can be added to items now.

Subject Whirlwind~
Text
So, going through Bandar with the liliputians, and think i may have
recreated the situation that occurred with the whirlwind PK from the other
day.  If you've already done so, ignore the rest of this message.  :)

Essentially, while Player A guards Player B, and Player B is engaged with
mob Dockworker, PLayer A cannot use whirlwind, they as they are not engaged
directly.  

To get around this, one might use Whirlwind Dockworker, which will allow you
to target a specific mob.  When you do so, it hits ALL Dockworkers in the
room.  

Ergo, if you used whirlwind man, it hits all MAN objects in the room,
including players.  

Anyway, unless they were good at reading spam, its completely possible they
picked up their guardee in the process of whirlwind, and then made them the
next target and killed their alt, essentially.  

Just a thought in case it was still up in the air.
