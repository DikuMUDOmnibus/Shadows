Something screwy happened to this skill...  It's suddenly available at
all gainers/trainers.  I couldn't figure out how to fix it...  The only
thing I noticed is that it doesn't have a gsn associated with it, so I
temporarily raised its level to 100 so morts couldn't get at it and to give
you time to look at it.

Per keron...  

Whirlwind should be checked into because you can whirl all in a room and
find people that are hiding regardless of how well hidden, also OP, can
whirl all fades and kill them a lowish level.

The adjustments to whirlwind will go in on the next patch day.  Hidden
and camouflaged players and mobs will no longer be drawn into combat with
the use of 'whirl all'.
