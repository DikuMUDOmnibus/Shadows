Developed at: DIKU -- The Department of Computer Science
                      at the University of Copenhagen.


All Wheel of Time references are related to the Wheel of Time world that the author Robert Jordan has created.
Obviously, we can not duplicate his work here, or even come close to his level of detail, but without his ideas, we would not be here.
~

-1 WEEKLY~
~

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
The Wheel of Time's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold
coins are worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to
the pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Gems can be bought
to alleviate weight problems from the jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more
than they are worth.  10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more
than 100 gold pieces for the highest quality stones.  
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game.  Typing
brief toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move
around (considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.  

Compact mode will toggle the appearance you see on other character {WIF{x they
have introduced them self to you.  
~

94 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "[hp/max_hp end/max_end]" prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current endurance
        %M :  Display your maximum endurance
        %x :  Display your current experience
{         %p :  Display your current OP
{         %P :  Display your maximum OP
	%X :  Display experience to level
        %g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display silver carried
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mend>

Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100end>"

Also help on: DAMAGE DEATH EXPERIENCE NEWS STORY TICK WIZLIST
~

0 DEATH~
DEATH When your character takes enough damage that you can no longer
fight, you are not killed outright, only subdued.  

This means you can no longer interact with anyone until such time as you
either receive proper healing, or you heal on your own by means of rest. 
Subdual has various negative affects on experience, but it is still much
better than dying.  

It is however possible for your character to be killed outright.  In this
case, you lose all RP you have up to this point.  In essence you are not the
same character, you must begin all guild affiliations anew and make friends
again.  

Death is brought about by someone subdueing you while you are both
Completely IC (in RP mode) and then using the "finish" command to finish you
off.  You will be dropped to level 1 and sent through creation again, and
then given enough experience to make it back up to a certain percentage of
your old level.  
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/end regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.  

Of these timers, the hp/end regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.  

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the
ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.  
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 NOTUSED7~
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST STAND WAKE SLEEP~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: tell  <character-list> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

Example for group tell:
tell name1,name2,name3,name4 Hello, this is a group tell!

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

-1 CHANGES CHANGE~
Please see '{Whelp weekly{x' for resent changes.
~

0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: gossip  <message>
Syntax: cgossip <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP and CGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a 
synonym for GOSSIP.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~

0 EMOTE PMOTE PEMOTE~
Command:  emote/pmote/pemote <action>

The emote command is used to express emotions or actions for RP.  To use
it, type 'emote' followed by the action you want your character to portray. 
Using double-quotes around words in an emote will say them just as if you
were using the say command.  

The pemote command is exactly the same as emote except that it adds 's to
your name, so it can be used for possessive actions.  The pmote command
works the same as well, but if someone's name is in the emote, it will
replace it with 'you' for that character; for example, typing 'pmote bonks
Target on the head' will display as '<person> bonks you on the head' to
Target and '<person> bonks Target on the head' to everyone else.  
~

52 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold <object> Syntax: remove <object> Syntax: wear <object>
Syntax: wear all Syntax: wield <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start
using it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources.  And WEAR is for armor. 
WIELD is for weapons.  

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.  

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if it is too heavy for
you, or if you are not experienced enough to use it properly.  

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.  
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.

Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE~

SACRIFICE offers an object to Mota, who may reward you.  The nature of the
reward depends upon the type of object.  
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 QUAFF~

This command uses up the object. When a herbal potion is depleted, it will be consumed.
~

0 CONSIDER~

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
In order of difficulty, the current messages are:
 
is not worth the effort
You won't even break a sweat
Looks like he'd be good for sparring practice
Looks like it'd be a fair fight
might hurt a bit
could be taken, on a really good day
Will bring on the pain
and
Just walk away
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL~
Command: recall <area>

The recall command lets you automatically travel to certain parts of the
world at the cost of half your endurance.  It can only be used by staying in
a room for one minute; if it is used before a minute has passed, a message
will display indicating how much longer you have to wait.  

Typing 'recall' without an argument will return you to the newbie school,
and you will also return to the newbie school automatically if you recall
before graduating.  Otherwise, type 'recall' with the name of a place to
recall to it.  

Most cities in the world and areas of interest can be recalled to by typing
'recall' and the first word of their name, though there are some exceptions;
to recall to Tar Valon or the White Tower, type 'recall tar valon'.

There are a few rooms in which you cannot recall, so be careful!  
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 SMELT GEMCUT~
Skill Type: Active
Command: smelt/gemcut <ore/gem> excellent/flawless

The smelt and gemcut skills are used to process ores and gems of lower
quality into higher-quality grades to make better materials for crafting
armor and jewelry.  This requires five of the same lower-quality grade of
ore/gem to process into a higher grade, but the smelt and gemcut skills
cannot be used to create perfect ores/gems; five flawed ore/gems can be made
into one excellent, and five excellent can be made into one flawless. 
Training this skill makes the smelting/gemcutting process more likely to
succeed.  
 
It costs {Y50 gold{x to smelt/gemcut.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN TRAINING GAIN GAINING~
Syntax: gain list
Syntax: gain <skill/weave>
Syntax: train
Syntax: train list
Syntax: train [amount] <skill/weave>
Syntax: train [amount] hp
Syntax: train [amount] endurance

The '{Wgain{x' and '{Wtrain{x' command is used to learn and develop certain skills
or weaves that you have the ability to adapt.  

The '{Wgain list{x' command will alow you to see what skills or weaves a gainer
mobile can teach you.
 
The '{Wtrain list{x' command will alow you to see that skills or weaves a trainer
mobile can train you in.

There is also the ability to gain knowledge in a skill or weave from other players.
Refer to the '{Whelp teach{x' section for help on how to teach.
~

94 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

94 TRUST 'TRUSTED MORTALS'~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

94 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

94 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

59 DENY~

name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

94 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

57 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

53 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is

This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

94 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

94 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

94 SET~

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.

given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.

Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim

Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

94 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer

      purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all
the NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges
one character from anywhere in the world.

	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

94 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of

location).
~

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

94 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

~

94 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

94 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.

on the number and size of these blocks.
~

56 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>

the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

94 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

94 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

94 PEACE~

94 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

94 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

94 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not

~

94 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>

Syntax: wiznet 	
        wiznet show
        wiznet status

the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

Aligning Matrixes, you will find weaves of {yEarth{x and {RFire{x will form into an
enchant weapon weave which increases the weapon's to-hit and to-dam bonuses
by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon
grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or destroyed

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' BOARDS~
Syntax:

note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note list from <sender>                 List notes from <sender> only.
note list to <to list>                  List notes to <to list> only.

note search from <sender>               Search all areas for a matching sender.
note search to <to list>                Search all areas for a matching to list.
note write                              Uses online editor to create note.
note catchup [all]                      Marks all notes in this area as read.
note clear                              Clear a working note.
note format                             Format a note in progress.
note adjust <number>                    Edit a note already posted.
note forward <number> <to list>         Forward a note.
note to                                 Sets who the note goes to.
note subject                            Sets the subject of the note.

note post leaderpost                    Post the note as guild leader.
note post facelesspost                  Post the note as faceless (Logged).

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one area,
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the areas is accomplished using the 'note area' command.
By using the 'note scan' command gives you a list of all areas together with number of
unread message. To change, type 'note area <number>' or 'note area <name of the board>'.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

Make sure you type {WNOTE POST{x once you have finished typing the note in
to submit it to the note area.

THE IMMORTALS AT SHADOWS OF THE WHEEL ALSO STRONGLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO
RESPECT ROLEPLAY.  

* No one else may play, or be in control of your character.  You are
responsible for any action your character engages in, and no excuse of lost
passwords or roomates logging into your character will suffice.  If you do
not want to lose your character, then ensure that no one has access to it. 

You should only have {YONE MAJOR{x character at a time unless once of them is an
immortal granted character.  A major character includes 1 Aes Sedai in the
White Tower, 1 Guild leader of any type, etc.  If you are in such a
position, you should dedicate your time to developing your character and
helping the guild that you are a part of.  

You may have two characters on at the same time, but they may not interact
in groups.  You may gather equipment for your alts, but not quest equipment
or items and you may not have them in the same group.  

Please see help rules for more information.

0 HOOD HOODAPP HOODAPPEARANCE CLOAK~
Syntax: cloak
Syntax: hood
Syntax: hoodappearance [<appearance>]

Cloaks have the ability to be wrapped around your body and thus hide your
equipment with the exception of those that are held or wielded.  To be able
to cloak yourself, you will need a cloak that is worn -about- body.  The
cloak should also have the keyword "cloak" in its short description or it
will not work.  

Cloaks also have the ability to fully conceal your appearance, using the
command known as hood.  The hood command will conceal you behind a cloak as
long as it has a hood.  

Before you can raise your hood, you need to set a hood appearance for your
self.  The hood appearance needs to have the following keywords in it: 

{yKeyword{x 1.) {WHooded{x or {Whood{x.
{yKeyword{x 2.) {WFigure{x or {Wcreature{x.

Example: hoodapp A hooded figure

Using the '{Whoodappearance{x' command without an argument will simply display the
short string of the hooded cloak that you are wearing about your body.  
 
To uncloak and unhood, retype the commands again. They will toggle the option.
 
{RRULES FOR HOOD APPEARANCES:{x
o Offensive strings will quality you for deletion.
o Strings including reserved words such as Creator etc. are not allowed.
o Extremely long strings are not allowed.
 
Should any of the above rules be broken, be prepared to suffer the consequences.

0 LOST_TALENT~
By the first century AB, letters reliably attributed to Aes Sedai
spoke of forgotten Talents and lost abilities, and bemoaned the vast
knowledge of the Power that is gone and may be centuries in the rediscovery.

Choosing the 'lost talent' talent does not guarantee that your character
spark any talent, nor give the player a carte blanche to RP having any lost
talent they wish.  

However, you have a small chance to spark a talent the letters to the Aes
Sedai speak of.  Which talents are lost is unknown until such a day where
one with the ability spark a lost talent.  
~

0 IGNORE~
Syntax: ignore <player>
Syntax: ignore list

The ignore command let you remove the ability for a player to send you tells

To remove a player from the ignore list repeat the command for adding a

'ignore list'

The ignore list is flushed each time you log out of the game.

The 'draw' command will draw a sheathed weapon into your good hand, or your
off-hand if you know the dual wield skill.

The 'Autochannel' command let a channeler set the amount of OP to seize or
embrace in percentage of their max OP.
 
The auto channeling amount will only be used when the seize/embrace command, or
the channeling command is used without an argument. The auto channeling amount will also
be used if you are not holding OP and try to combine flows into a weave.

The auto channeling amount set will be used each time you type seize/embrace/channel
without an argument. E.g. Setting it to 10% will each time seize/embrace
10% of your max OP.

1) Four players are required to start a new guild, and must stay active
for a guild to continue to stay open.  To petition for a new guild, the four
players need to note to guild admin, in the guild note area.  This does not
guarantee that the guild will be opened, and will be at the discretion of
the admin.  Subguilds will subsequently be opened on an as needed basis.  

2) Guild leaders rank 1-3 must log on for a minimum of five hours per week,
being visible to the guild and the mud for guild matters and RP.  If the
guild leader is going to be away from the mud, a note to the guild and guild
admin explaining the absense is expected.  While this is the minimum time,
attention will be paid to the following rule as well.  

3) Guild leaders rank 1-2 must play their leader character as their primary
character, or risk losing not only the position, but that character.  This
does not mean that guildleaders may not play alts, but if the admin notices
that the guild leader is neglecting their guild leader alt for another alt,
then the admin may choose for something untoward to happen to the guild
leader to allow others more willing to put time and RP into the position to
have a chance at it.  

* Guilds thrive when their leaders are logging on and taking an active role
in the guild.  Guild leaders have a responsibility toward this end, and
shirking it may cause the player to lose the guild leader position, as well
as their character.  

4) A person with a guild leader character (guild level 1-3) may not have his
or her alt(s) raise any higher than guild level 4.  

5) Guild leaders rank 1-2 may not be absence for more than 2 weeks without
notice.

0 CHANNELING ONEPOWER 'ONE POWER'~
Since this mud is based on Robert Jordan's series Wheel of Time, there
is no 'magic' system. The system that we use here is the 'channeling' system
which was incorporated into the series. The people who wielded the ability
to channel were known as channelers (aka channies in mud slang). By 'weaving'
5 'spheres', known as Air, Earth, Fire, Water and Spirit, they are able to
manipulate and control their environment in numerous ways.
 
First we will go over the basics of the ability to channel. The Power which is
used is known as the One Power, or True Source. This Power is divided into
two halves, Saidin and Saidar. Saidin is the male half of the one power, and
is known to be corrupt. For more help on this corruption, see 'help taint'. The
other half, Saidar, is the female half of the one power, which is not tainted
or corrupted. Great things were done in the Age of Legends, which is when both
halves of the One Power could be safely used. At this time, the last male
Aes Sedai has been dead several thousand years. It is said that the One Power,
or True Power (which very little at all is known of), is what turns the
Wheel of Time itself.
 
Weaving the one power is a complex thing to learn, requiring years of training
for most young women to master. By combining the five spheres, a channeler can
cause a great many things to occur. Each sphere has its strengths and
weaknesses, yet when brought together they can have surprising results.
 
(See also: TAINT, SPHERES, WHITETOWER, AESSEDAI) 
~

0 SAIDIN TAINT INSANITY~
Saidin, the Male half of the True Source, was tainted when the Dark One
was sealed in the bore.  The Dark One's counterstroke is what caused this
taint.  Men who wield the One Power are destined to go mad, and are said to
die while their body literally rots around them.  It is not known at this
time if it is possible to cleanse Saidin.  

Please keep in mind that if you are IC and actively channel, or roleplay for
a certain amount of time as a male channeler, you will see the taint affect
you in different ways.  Some experience headaches, some are overcome by
panic attacks, everyone is different.  
 
(See also HELP CHANNELING)
~

0 SPHERES SPHERE AIR EARTH FIRE WATER SPIRIT~
The five spheres, {W{WAir{x{x, {yEarth{x, {RFire{x, {BWater{x, and {YSpirit{x, are the separate
pieces of both {WSaidar{x and {DSaidin{x.  When woven together in various amounts
and in certain ways, they are what combines to do the work of the channeler.

All channelers are stronger in some areas than others.  A channeler who is
very powerful in Air, even to the point of creating spectacular weaves that
can change the weather itself, may be so weak in Fire that a small spark to
ignite a campfire is difficult.  While the first four spheres are rather
obvious in the things they manipulate, Spirit could be considered the sphere
of the body.  While all healing requires all five spheres to some extent,
Spirit is used to delve and explore.  It is also thought to be the sphere
used in Bonding.  
~

-1 AIEL SAVAGE WASTE~
In the area which is east of the Dragonwall, or the Spine of the World as
some call it, there is a vast desert land inhabitied by a people known as
the Aiel.  The Aiel call their land the Three-Fold Land, however those who
live east of the Dragonwall, called wetlanders by the Aiel, refer to this
land as the Aiel Waste.  The harshness of the desert, and the fact that they
allow only merchants, gleemen, and Tinkers into their lands has lent a
certain mystery to this people.  All others that are caught are stripped of
their clothing and equipment, given one waterskin, and sent back towards the
Dragonwall.  

The Aiel people themselves are known to be warriors, but according those
those few who are allowed to view their life, they are not only warriors,
but also have farmers, craftsmen, and all other skilled crafts people which
are needed to carry out their daily lives.  Those Aiel who are warriors are
members of what are called Societies.  Each warrior is training in the use
of the bow, spear, and hand to hand fighting, however none will pick up a
sword as they consider it forbidden.  

The Aiel people are divided into 12 distinct clans, each with their own
unique characteristics and traits.  All members however follow a moral code
which is known as ji'e'toh.

0 ALTARA ALTARAN~
"{x{BLean back on your knife and let your tongue go free.  {x" --Common Altaran
saying.  

Altara faces the Sea of Storms, wedged between the more powerful nations of
Illian and Amadicia, with northern borders touching Murandy, Andor, and
Ghealdan.  It is unified only in name.  Most of the inhabitants prefer to
identify themselves as belonging to a particular Lord or Lady, rather than a
subject of the Queen or a citizen of Altara.  Even the nobles seem to care
little for their nation, seldom paying taxes or offering more than lip
service to the Crown.  

The sigil of Altara is two golden leopards, one above the other.  The Golden
Leopards or the Leopards as it is often referred to.  It's banner is the
Golden Leopards on a field checked four by four in red and blue with red
being next to the staff on the topmost row.  Altara's capital city is Ebou
Dar and her symbol is the Throne of Winds.  She is ruled by a Queen.  

The Throne of Winds is slightly more than a prize to be taken by the most
powerful noble, although many powerful nobles have scorned to take it when
given the opportunity.  In the thousand years since Hawkwing's death, only
one house has held the throne for as much as five consecutive generations
and when they lost it their fall was so complete that the House had become
subservient to all others.  No other House has ever been able to put more
than two consecutive rulers on the throne.  Altara is under pressure from
Amadicia and there is no doubt that the Children of the Light wish to
control it, for its sovereignty is all that keeps them from controlling the
river trade on the Eldar, or marching on Murandy and perhaps even Illian. 
If not for Illian's intervention during the Whitecloak war, they would have
succeeded.  A weakly knit land such as Altara is an easy target for those
with the power to take it.  

Altara does have a national character though.  Her people, especially the
women, are fierce and bold.  They are extremely polite, yet quick to answer
an insult with steel.  Highborn or low, man or woman, all are equal on the
dueling ground.  This is most evident in the capital city of Ebou Dar,
center of Altaran culture and commerce.  

Altarans can often be recognized by their dark hair, dark eyes, and olive
complexion, but those from Ebou Dar are also easily recognized by their
distinctive attire.  Women's dresses are often pale in color with snug
bodices and full skirts over bright petticoats.  The necklines of commoners
are cut very narrow and deep, while for nobiles the bodice has a round or
oval cutout, allowing those with a marriage knife to show them to best
advantage, and those without to show that their available.  For commoners
the skirt is always worn gathered above one knee to reveal the brilliantly
colored petticoats beneath, while noblewomen wear it raised in the front. 
Large hoop earrings are worn by most women and some men.  Men and women
alike wear curved daggers through their belts or sashes, and often carry a
work knife as well.  

The trademark of the Ebou Dari man is his long, elaborate vest.  These vests
are often as brightly colored as a Tinker's clothes, and are worn alone or
over pale shirts with wide sleeves.  

Sometimes the wealthy add a decorative silk coat slung about the shoulders,
since it is deliberately too small to be worn conventionally.  This "cape"
is held with a chain of silver or gold strung between the narrow embroidered
lapels.  When the cape is worn a long narrow sword is usually carried, in
addition to the standard dagger.  Both men and women adorn their hands with
rings.  

As in most cultures, the wealthy use silks and brocades with embroidery,
often set with jewels, while the poor and middle-class use wool, brass, and
glass.  

The Ebou Dari pride themselves on the ferocity of their women, and their
courage to duel.  Very few men or women reach adulthood without having
fought in at least one duel, and these few are ostracized for being
cowardly.

0 AMADICIA AMADICIAN~
The nation of Amadicia is well known for its primary controlling army, the 
Children of the Light. Led by their Lord Captain Commander, the Children 
essentially rule Amadicia from the Fortress of Light. Channeling is forbidden
within the borders of Amadicians, and the penalty is death. Death however comes
only after a long process of questioning.

0 AESSEDAI 'AES SEDAI'~
Aes Sedai are the primary known wielders of the One Power.  Since the
Breaking of the World, all known Aes Sedai are women.  Aes Sedai live longer
than non channelers, and are known to develop an ageless face.  Those who
are the age of many grandmothers are said to have only one or two white
hairs in their heads and no lines or visible wrinkles.  They are bound by
the Three Oaths they swear upon being raised to Aes Sedai, but other than
that are only limited by their strength and ability in the One Power.  The
Ajah they are a part of is marked by the color of the fringe on the shawls
they wear.  
 
(See also: AJAH, OATHS)
~

0 WHITETOWER 'WHITE TOWER'~
The White Tower is the central structure on the island city of Tar Valon.
Designed by Aes Sedai, it was created by Ogier aided by Aes Sedai wielding
the One Power.  The main building is three hundred feet across at its base,
and rises five hundred feet above the ground.  The structure is composed of
white stone, slightly wider at the base than the top.  

Aes Sedai are housed in the top portion of the White Tower.  Each Ajah has
their own pie shaped section of the Aes Sedai levels.  The bottom half of
the Tower is reserved for general purposes.  A smaller structure is attached
to the back of the main building and houses Novices and Accepted.  The front
of the White Tower faces a large public square, which is bordered by various
public buildings which were both ogier built and designed.  The entire White
Tower complex is enclosed by a stone wall.  This perimeter is broken
occasionally by columns and rails.  

The largest building on the Tower complex is located behind the Novice and
Accepted Quarters.  This is the Great Library which contains offices,
workrooms, and one of the largest collections of knowledge in the world.

0 AJAH~
An Ajah is "a sisterhood of Aes Sedai".  In current times there are seven
known ajahs, each associated with a color.  There are Red, Yellow, Green,
Blue, Brown, Grey, and White Ajahs.  Each Ajah has their own set of three
Sitters in the Hall of the Tower to represent them.  As well, each Ajah has
their own ruler or ruling council, but the head of the Ajah is not
necessarily a Sitter for the Ajah.  The actual identity of these Ajah
leaders is often not shared amoung the Aes Sedai of different Ajahs.  There
is rumored to be an eighth Ajah, the Black Ajah, but no Aes Sedai seems
willing to speak of it.

~

0 REDAJAH 'RED AJAH'~
The primary goal of the Aes Sedai of this Ajah is to protect the lands
from all men who wield the One Power.  Men who can channel are hunted down
by these Aes Sedai and brought to the Tower to be gentled.  Because of their

Ajah is the largest and is led by a single woman.

for Tarmon Gai'don, The Last Battle with the Dark One.  They are both fierce
fighters of Shadowspawn, and are known to be involved in many of history's
great battles.  The unique aspect of this Ajah's members is an appreciation
of men, which is reflected in their bonding of multiple men.

~

0 'STUDY RESIDUE'~
Skill Type: Active (Residues Talent)
Command: studyresidue

The study residue skill allows you to learn weaves by observing the area
in which someone else has used the weave, allowing you to study and get a
sense of how it works.  Obviously, this only works on weaves used by members
of your own gender; men cannot study the residues of weaves from women, and
vice-versa.  

This skill can only be used in a room where someone of your gender has used
weaves, which is denoted by a message in the room saying 'You feel residues
of flows recently woven here!  ' When you see this message, use the
'raffects' command to see what weaves exist.  You will be able to see the
threads used (Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and/or Water), the name of the weave
if you know it, and the number of ticks that the residue will remain.  Any
weave you do not know will display 'something' as the name.  Once this is
done, enter 'studyresidue' to try to figure out what the first 'something'
weave in the list is.  The skill can be used multiple times until you learn
the weave, and once you do, you will gain it for free at a skill level of 1.

Cost is not a factor when determining if you can learn a weave, so you can
study weaves that you do not actually have the spheres to cast.  However,
many weaves granted by talents will be difficult or impossible to learn with
this skill.  

One note: This skill IS NOT A REPLACEMENT for IC teaching!  If you gain a
weave with this skill that you do not or cannot have ICly (because you are
ICly just learning to use the Power or the like), you are advised to
restrict its use to OOC.  If it is found that this skill is being used to
gain weaves that a character should not have and then affects RP, there will
be consequences.  In addition, using this skill ICly while another person is
in the room should be emoted as such, because someone staring off into space
does tend to draw attention.  
~

0 STILL~
Syntax: cast 'still' <victim>

Severs the ability of a channeler to be able to use the One Power or even to
touch the True Source.  This weave requires very large flows of all five of

0 ARAD DOMAN DOMANI~
"{x{gA man who trades with a Domani needs three sets of wits.  {x" --Warning
against foolishness

Arad Doman lies between the Mountains of Mist and the Aryth Ocean, just
north of the Almoth Plain.  Though the plain is officially unclaimed, Arad
Doman has long maneuvered for control of it against Tarabon.  The Domani
believe they are descendants of those who made the Tree of Life, but it is
the Domani women that are legendary.  Copper-skinned and exceedingly
graceful, they are said to be able to twist a man around their wrist with a
look, and imprison his heart with a smile.  The clothes they wear are
considered scandalous by most other standards.  Their dresses cover their
bodies from neck to toes, but are barely opaque and cling to every curve,
revealing nothing while hinting at everything.  Only the women of the Sea
Folk move with more sensual grace than the Domani, and no other woman can
compare to the Domani when it comes to practicing the art of seduction,
which mothers begin teaching their daughters in girlhood.  Most Domani
merchants are women, and the nation owes its wealth to their success.  Few
men come off victor in trade with a Domani woman, but they often consider
losing worth the experience.  

Domani men are recognizable by their long, thin mustaches and earrings. 
Both men and women of nobility wear jewelry engraved or embossed with the
symbols of their House.  As much as the women are known for their beauty,
the men are known for their temper.  It has been suggested that it is
dealing with Domani women which gives them such a temper.  Others say it is
eating with 'sursa'.  (Sursa is pretty much chopsticks.  They use them in
Arad Doman) 

The capital of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban, also their trade center.  Though
the Domani do not like to travel the sea, Domani merchants carry on major
trade with the Sea Folk, and then disperse the goods to inland consumers. 
They also trade heavily with Tarabon and Saldaea.  Their sigil is a silver
hand grasping a silver sword by the blade, point down...  The Sword and
Hand, and their banner is the Sword and Hand on a field of four green and
three blue horizontal stripes.

0 TARABON TARABONER~
Tarabon is nominally ruled jointly by a king and a panarch, who are both
elected by the Assembly of Lords.  The King and the Panarch are equal in
authority.  The Panarch collects taxes, customs, and duties, controls the
Civil Watch, and oversees the lower courts.  Her personal guard is the
Panarch's Legion.  The King is responsible for spending the collected
revenue properly, controls the army, and oversees the High Court.  His
personal guard is the King's Life Guard.  The only major political duty of
the Assembly of Lords is the election of both King and Panarch.  

In Tarabon, it is considered impolite to completely reveal one's face except
when eating or drinking.  As a result, both men and women wear a transparent
veil across the face.  When anonymity is required, they may even don a mask
to completely cover the features.  

Taraboner men often sport facial hair under the veil in the form of a thick
mustache, and wear a dark cylindrical cap on their thick dark hair.  Both
lords and commoners wear baggy white trousers and coats embroidered with
scrollwork on the shoulders, though the lords' coats are usually of finer
material and their much more elaborate embroidery is often gold. 
Loose-fitting shirts with embroidered chests are worn under the coats. 
Occasionally trousers are embroidered as well.  

Noblewomen veil their faces, but they do not believe in hiding their
figures.  Most wear clinging gowns of thin silk that are almost as revealing
as those worn by Domani women.  Peasant women also prefer thin fabric,
though their dresses are usually made out of drab wool, quite coarse in
comparison to their betters'.  

Household servants wear wool, but of a finer quality than that available to
most peasants, with the sigil of the House embroidered on the breast.  

Tarabon's sigil is a golden tree with a thick bole and spreading branches
balanced by the roots below, the Golden Tree, and the banner is the Golden
Tree on a field of vertically striped red and white, four red and three
white.  The capital city is Tanchico and the country symbol is the Throne of
Light.

0 ILLIAN ILLIANER~
"{x{YYou may have any place you wish, so long as it is not larger than mine. 
{x" ---Fateful words of the first king of Illian 

Illian is a powerful nation on the Sea of Storms bordering the weaker
nations of Altara and Murandy.  Wealthy from sea-, land-, and river-borne
trade, Illian protected the weaker Altara during the Whitecloak Wars to
insure that the nation would remain a buffer between Illian and Amadicia. 
In Illian, the King is not the sole political leader of the nation.  He is
"advised" by a council of lords, known as the Council of Nine.  Historically
these nine lords usually end up contending with the ruler for power.  The
King's power is further weakened by the presence of a second "advisory"
body, known as the Assemblage.  Chosen by and from Illian's merchants and
ship owners, they too end up contending for power more often than giving
useful advice to either the Council of Nine or the King.  The result is that
no one person or group actually controls Illian's destiny.  There is always
a three way battle over any task or legislation.  

Most men of Illian wear long coats with raised collars and beards that leave
their upper lip bare.  Many lords also wear boots fringed with gold or
silver.  

Women, both high and low, favor wide-brimmed hats held in place by long
scarves that are wound around the neck in a utilitarian and decorative
fashion.  High ladies adorn themselves with decorative slippers heavily
worked with gold and silver.  Their dresses are cut high at the hem to show
the slippers to best advantage.  The dresses also usually have low-cut
necklines to show the lady's natural assets to best advantage as well.  

The sigil of Illian is nine golden bees arranged in a diamond, from top to
bottom 1-2-3-2-1...  The Golden Bees, and the banner is Nine Golden Bees on
a field of green.  The banner is fringed in gold if flown where the
sovereign is present.  The capital city of Illian is of the same name and
it's symbol is the Laurel Crown.  
~

0 TEAR TAIREN~
The nation of Tear lies just east of Illian and contains the greatest
port on the Sea of Storms.  This port is located well above the mouth of the
River Erinin, and is guarded by the ancient fortress known as the Stone of
Tear.  Unlike other major ports, however, Tear's is not easily accessible to
the ocean.  It is protected by the winding maze of waterways within the vast
delta at the mouth of the Erinin known as the Fingers of the Cragon.  These
waterways are under complete control of the Tairens, who will not allow
ships to pass in or out through them without a Tairen pilot aboard.  Perhaps
unskilled sailors would be lost without a pilot, but for most voyagers, such
as the Sea Folk, the precaution is laughable.  

Unlike most other nations, Tear has no one ruler, no king or queen.  A
council known as the High Lords of Tear rule together and as a body.  The
members of this council must all be of particular rank, but there is no
fixed number of lords on the council, the membership has varied from as many
as twenty to as few as six.  All decisions are presented to the people as
unanimous.  The Lords of the Land- all the lesser Tairen Lords- then
participate in carrying out the edicts of the High Lords.  

The High Lords rule from the Stone of Tear, a massive fortress that
dominates the city of Tear like a small mountain.  The Stone is believed to
be the oldest stronghold of mankind.  It was built sometime during or
shortly after the Breaking of the World, and was made using the One Power. 
The One Power was used to draw stone from every corner of the world and fuse
it together into a single massive structure without seam or joint or mortar.
The Stone has been attacked and besieged over a hundred times and has never
fallen.  The Stone also holds the great sa'angreal sword called Callandor. 
The High Lords perform the Rite of Guarding four times a year, claiming to
be guarding the world from the Dragon Reborn, who would be the only man to
take the Stone and claim Callandor.  The Lords of the Land are also raised
to High Lords here and no one enters the Stone without permission.  Besides
Callandor, the Stone also contains a large cache of angreal and ter'angreal
that rivals that of the White Tower.  It is not certain whether the Tairen's
collected these artifacts to preserve them or hide them as all channeling is
outlawed in Tear.  

Tairen lords wear colorful coats of padded silks and brocades with puffy
sleeves, sometimes colored in stripes.  Their breeches are tight to show a
well-muscled leg to best advantage, and are often brightly colored.  Regular
soldiers are uniformed with brilliant red coats with wide sleeves ending in
narrow white cuffs.  A gleaming breastplate is worn over the coat so as to
let the sleeves show clearly.  Their breeches are often of the same tight
cut as that of the lords, though not quite so brightly colored, and are worn
tucked into knee- high boots.  Defenders of the Stone wear black and gold
coats with puffy sleeves as well as plumes of various colors on their rimmed
round helmets to mark officers and under officers.  The soldiers of a
particular lord wear that lord's colors on their puffy sleeves.  Common men
wear baggy breeches, usually tied at the ankle and held up by a broad
colored sash.  Some few wear coats, but unlike the lord's, theirs are long
and dark, fitting tightly to the wearer's arms and chest, then becoming
wider below the waist.  Sometimes low shoes or boots are worn, but more
often bare feet or clogs are preferred to traverse the mud of the poorer
quarters.  Most common men wear cloth or straw hats to keep out of the sun. 
Dockmen and other laborers wear the same baggy breeches, but are bare
chested with a long vest.  

The noble ladies wear long dresses with necklines cut to bare shoulders and
considerable bosom.  Silk is the material of preference and their dresses
are often adorned with a lace ruff and tiny matching cap.  Tairen widows
wear white, and have been known to wear the color while their dying husband
still lived.  No self-respecting lady is ever without her tiny bottle of
smelling salts.  

Common women wear chin-high collars that reveal nothing, and ankle-high
hems.  The dresses are often adorned with pale-colored aprons, usually in a
combination of two or three of progressively larger size, each smaller than
the one beneath it.  Hats, when worn, are wide-brimmed straw often dyed to
match the aprons.  
 
~

0 MAYENE MAYENER~
Mayene rests on the end of a peninsula in the Sea of Storms, hemmed in by
the looming bulk of Tear to the west and the Drowned Lands to the north.  It
is actually an independant city-state, rather than a nation, though Tear
claims it as a province despite Mayene's protests.  What fragile
independence Mayeners have is maintained through their one major asset, the
secret oilfish shoals.  The lamp oil produced from the oilfish here rivals
that from the olive groves of Tear, Illian, and Tarabon.  That oil is a
major source of Mayene's wealth and her fragile independence.  Despite
Tear's provincial claim, no Tairen knows where the oilfish shoals are
located, and the Mayeners are determined to keep it that way.  

The ruling family of Mayene claims to be descended from Artur Hawkwing, and
uses the Paendrag name.  The man or woman who rules Mayene is styled "the
First," which once meant the first lord or lady.  Originally there was also
a single "second" lord or lady, but over that last four hundred years the
tradition changed so that several lords and ladies held the title at once. 



Because of the constant threat from Tairen assassins, all the high lords and
ladies are trained in basic self-defense, so that they need not rely solely
on their personal guards for protection.  The city-state itself is protected
by the Mayener Winged Guards, the First's personal guard.  Their gleaming
red breastplates and red-streamered lances have been seen at the forefront
of many conflicts throughout the history of Mayene.  

Mayene's sigil is a golden hawk in flight, the Golden Hawk and her banner is
the Golden Hawk in flight on a field of blue.  It is sometimes called
Paendrag's Banner by Mayeners and is fringed in gold if flown where the
First is present.  
~

0 MURANDY MURANDIAN~
Murandy lies north of Altara and south of Andor.  Similar to Altara, the
people of Murandy do not respect their nations as much as they respect their
local nobility.  The King officially rules Murandy, but the actual power is
divided between the all but independant lords and ladies who rule their own
little patches of land.  The king seldom has little control over events in
the capital city of Lugard, much less in the rest of the country.  Most
believe that the only reason the Murandians even have a ruler at all is as a
deterrent against annexation by neighboring nations, for their lack of
national cohesion does not stop Murandians from being extremely suspicious
of outsiders.  Most see every foreign action as part of a plot.  Andorans
are particularly hated, mostly because of a long history of fights along
their common border, though, close to the border the two people are almost
indistinguishable except by their dress.  

The sigil of Murandy is a red bull, the Red Bull, and her banner is the Red
Bull on a field of vertically striped blue and white, three blue and two
white.  The banner is fringed in red when flown where the sovereign is
present.  
~

0 Ghealdan Ghealdanin~
Small Ghealdan lies between Amadicia and Altara with its back against
Garen's Wall.  It is a relatively quiet and self-sufficient nation that is
ruled by either a King or a Queen who sits on the Light Blessed Throne. 
Ghealdan's greatest worry is possible conquest from Amadicia.  The rulers do
not seem to last long in Ghealdan and it is suspected that the Lords of
Ghealdan's High Crown Council have had a hand in removing the failed rulers.


Ghealdan's sigil is three silver stars arranged one above and two below... 
The Stars or the Silver stars, and the banner is the Stars on a field of
red.  The capital city is Jehannah and the symbol is the Light Blessed
Throne.

0 Saldaea Saldaean~
"{x{WMy heart rises with the sun.  To the chime of swords, I die at sunset... 
{x" --From a Saldaean poem

Saldaea is the largest Border nation.  It stretches from the cliffs of the
Aryth Ocean, known as the World's End, to the River Arinelle and the
northern edge of the Black Hills and it covers more area than Shienar and
Arafel combined.  Saldaea is usually ruled by a Queen.  Her sigil is three
silver fish, one above the other, the Silver Fish and her banner is the
Silver Fish on a field of blue.  The capital city is Maradon.  

The people are known for their distinctively tilted almond-shaped eyes and
their military prowess.  The Saldaeans' ferocity in battle is equal to that
of the other Border nations, though their equestrian skills are far
superior.  They are the finest light cavalry in the known world.  

The Saldaean cavalry can perform mounted drills and maneuvers in units as
large as 9000 without a single horse or rider missing the mark.  They seem
more at home on a horse than on ground and can routienly perform stunts
normally only done by gleeman, but all on the backs of galloping horses. 
They can stand in the saddle on feet or hands, ride two horses at once with
one foot on the back of each, full speed dismounts and remounts and even
crawl completely under and around the charging animal.  

The Marshal-General is responsible for defending Saldaea and commanding the
military.  War for Saldaeans is a family event, though the women do not
participate in the fighting, the wives of most officers and all nobles
traditionally accompany their husbands on all campaigns except for those
into the Blight.  Girls are not taught the sword, but many are quite skilled
with knives or in hand to hand combat.  There are stories of Saldaean women
picking up their fallen husbands' swords and leading the men back into
battle.  

The usual mode of dress for Saldaean women reflects their strength of will,
consisting of high necked dress with long sleeves.  Highborn women often
wear elaborate embroidery down the sleeves and on the collar, and the dress
is often silk or brocade.  Farmgirls wear the same basic style, but in wool.
These farmgirls are just as fierce as their betters, known for shaving the
head of any woman caught poaching another's chosen male.  Men and women of
all classes usually travel armed with at least a knife though in Saldaea
steel is never drawn unless the wearer intends on using it.  

Saldaea's economy is strong, with brisk fur trade from trappers, fine woods
from forests, and ice peppers from farms.  These goods are usually shipped
to Mayene or Tear where they command a good price from nobility.  

Despite their otherwise formidable virtue, Saldaean women can be extremely
sensual.  Ladies of the court are known for the subtlety of their
seductions, using the language of fans to communicate their thoughts to
potential suitors.  The infamous ' sa'sara ' is a dance outlawed by a number
of Saldaean Queens for its indecency, and yet almost all noblewomen know how
to dance it, though only a few admit it publicly.  The sa'sara, when danced
by one who knows the moves, apparently has the ability to make men's blood
boil.  Saldaean history records three wars, two rebellions, and 47 unions
and feuds between noble houses, as well as innumberable duels, sparked by
women dancing the sa'sara.  There is even a tale of a defeated queen who
quelled the rebellion by dancing it for the victorious general.  He is said
to have married her and restored her throne, though the story has been
denied by every Queen of Saldaea.  
~

0 KANDOR KANDORI~
Kandor lies between the nations of Arafel and Saldaea, along the
Blightborder.  Though the martial arts are as highly developed here as in
any border nation, the Kandori have also developed a skill for trade and
alone of all the Border nations have established a highly respected guild
for merchants.  Though Chachin's nearness to the Blight prevents it from
being a center of commerce, the merchants have established a strong
reputation and have brought much wealth back with them.  Kandori men are
easily spotted by their distinctive forked beards, as well as on to three
silver chains worn over their coats.  Kandori also usually wear an earring,
and the earrings of some successful merchants guilds are quite ostentatious.
Members of nobility also wear chains over their coats and earrings.  

Kandor is ruled by Queen or King and the sigil is a rearing red horse, the
Red Horse.  The banner is the Red Horse on a field of pale green and the
capital city is Chachin.  
~

0 Arafel Arafellan~
"{rThe dancing is sweeter on the edge of a sword.  {x" --Saying in Arafel

Arafel lies just west of Shienar and is made up of more rugged country than
Shienar.  The men are easily recognized by their distinctive hairstyle. 
They wear their hair in two long braids, usually with silver bells on the
braid-ends.  Most of the natives of Arafel are pale-skinned and appear to
have unusually large eyes.  Like all Borderlanders, the Arafellin maintain a
strong military tradition for protection from creatures of the Blight. 
Arafellin warriors are skilled swordsmen.  They always wear two swords, both
strapped to their backs, one hilt over each shoulder, and are capable of
using both at once, one in each hand.  

Traditionally, Arafel is ruled by a King with the country's sigil being one
red rose and one white roses, or the Roses.  It's banner is of three white
roses on a field of red quartered with three red roses on a field of white. 
The capital city of Arafel is Shol Arbela.

Skill Type: Active, Attacking
Command: assassinate <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes (if it fails)

work.  

This skill may be used against mobs without issue, but there are some who
cannot be assassinated and will retaliate against anyone who tries.  Against
players, you cannot use this skill without being in the room for them for a
short amount of time (about forty-five seconds), which can be made easier by
hiding and sneaking.

0 Cairhien Carhienin~
"{x{CTake what you want, and pay for it.  {x" --Saying in Cairhien

The key to understanding Cairhien's history lies in the nature of its
people.  As a whole they are stern and unyielding, preferring the world
around them to adhere to strictly ordered aesthetics rather than natural
chaos.  Yet they thrive on the complexities of subtle political intrigue,
using the art of misdirection and hidden meanings to gain power and status. 
For a Cairhienin, nothing is as it seems, everything has a deeper meaning, a
hidden motive.  It was the nobles of Cairhien who took the style of intrigue
created by the White Tower, gave it their own twist, and made it into what
is now known as 'Daes Dae'mar', the dangerous and often deadly Game of
Houses.  The Great Game has gone on to infect all the southern nations at
least to some extent.  

The nation of Cairhien has been led by a King, though it will take a Queen
from time to time.  The royal palace lies in the capital city, Cairhien,
which bears the same name as the country itself.  The sigil of Cairhien is a
many-rayed golden rising sun, the Rising Sun.  It's banner is the Rising Sun
on a field of blue, it's symbol is the Sun Throne.  

Cairhienin upper-class dress reflects their desire for control and order. 
The people are shorter and more pale-skinned than Andorans, though with
darker hair, and the dark colors they prefer contrast with their fair skin. 
Men and women wear coats and dresses of black, or dark blue or green.  The
darkness is relieved by narrow horizontal slashes of color across the chest
and body, and dark ivory lace at the throat and wrists.  The number of color
slashes indicate the rank of the wearer while their color indicates their
House.  

The ladies wear their hair tightly coiffed into elaborate towers of curls
carefully designed as unique to the wearer.  The men wear their hair long,
with flat or bell-shaped velvet caps.  Formal wear is much the same, equally
dark, save that ladies' skirts are extremely wide and supported by hoops,
and the materials used are finer.  Even the liveried servants only have
color in a few stripes on the cuffs and their house badge embroidered on the
breast of coat or dress.  The ladies also wear a small gemstone suspended
from a thin chain of gold or silver in their hair.  

The lower classes are free from the restraints of the Great Game and they
are free to dress as they wish.  They often approach the extremes of
flamboyance that their betters avoid.  Their clothes may be ill-fitting and
shabby, but they are extremely colorful.  Bright skirts and shirts with
coats and shawls of equally bright, though often clashing, colors are quite
common.  

Military dress follows the same dark colors as the nobles, but with a few
embellishments.  Officers wear slashes of rank across their coats much as
nobles do, buth they shave the front of the head and often dust it with
white powder, leaving the hair hanging long in the back.  High-ranking
officers wear ornately gilded cuirasses as well as large white plumes
attached to their bell-shaped helmets and ornate gauntlets.  Lesser officers
and soldiers wear their hair cut short in a basic bowl cut.  Cairhienin
officers also wear small banners called "con" on short staffs on their
backs.  These enable easy location of officers or a particular lord's
personal retainers.

0 Malkier Malkieri~
Until its fall in 953 NE, Malkier was one of the oldest modern nations,
having been the first one to rebuild after the Hundred Years War.  It was
bordered by the Mountains of Dhoom to the north with Shienar and Arafel to
the south.  Before it's fall, it was a beautiful land with many lakes and
mountain vistas.  Though a noble land that strived to keep the Dark at bay,
jealously in the royal family led to the weakening of its armies and soon it
was unable to defend itself against the Trollocs that took advantange of
this weakness.  The survivors went south into the other Borderlands and
Malkier fell.  Today, most people of the Borderlands do not like to talk
about what happened to Malkier as it is a tragic story to tell.  

The Kings of Malkier were titled Lord of the Seven Towers, and Lord of the
Lakes, the last referring to Malkiers legendary thousand lakes.  Each of its
kings and queens took an oath to fight against the Shadow, and the king
carried a sword that never dulled.  The ruler of Malkier was a "Dai Shan",
which is Old Tongue ofr Diademed Battle Lord.  Unlike in other lands, the
spouse of the king or queen ruled just as equally as the king or queen
themself.  When a King would die, the Great Lords of the land would cast
rods upon the Crowning Stone to select the new king.  

Most refugees adopted the culture of their new homes.  There are a few here
and there who maintain the old ways, however they are losing more and more
of their culture as the years pass.  

Malkier was very military oriented.  Men wore their hair at shoulder length,
held off their faces with a thing, braided leather cord around the temples
called a 'hadori'.  The hadori symbolized their dedication to opposing the
Blight.  Women painted small dots call ki'sain in the center of their
foreheads, indicating their sons were pledged to fight the Shadow.  Malkieri
were usually tall, with dark, often black hair.  Women wore their hair loose
and long, usually down past their waists.  Women in mourning cut their hair
to shoulders or shorter.  A woman of marriageable age wore a blue ki'sain, a
woman mourning wore one of white.  Women preferred lightly-worked silk
dresses and the men wore coats in the Borderlands style.  Boys hair was left
long, cut to the shoulders only when they were deemed mature.  The cut hair
was often braided into a rope called a 'daori' of which the boy would give
to his first lover, called a 'carneira'.  Both men and women had carneira,
who were usually older than they were.  Young women chose their carneira and
young men were chosen by theirs.  Malkieri men had a saying that "your
carneira wears a part of your soul as a ribbon in her hair forever". 
Malkieri men were very protective of women and considered it rude to look
them full in the eyes.

0 Ogier Stedding~
"{x{gClear the field, smooth it low, Let no weed or stubble stand, Here we
labor, here we toil, here the towering trees will grow.  {x" --From an Ogier
Song

The Ogier do not have a specific country to call their own, instead they
live in secluded stedding scattered throughout the world.  They are the only
natural nonhuman race known.  Ogier resemble humans in general build and
dress, but are a genetically seperate species with long tufted ears and
broad, vaugely snoutlike noses.  Much larger than humans, the men average
ten feet in height with the women standing only slightly shorter.  A typical
Ogier life span is at least three or four times longer than a human's and
they are not considered old enough to leave the stedding until they've at
least reached 100 years old.  Their longer life is probably the reason for
their deliberately slow and certain behavior.  They consider humans much too
hasty and impatient.  

Ogier stedding are shielded from the One Power somehow and completely
prevents the One Power from being channeled or even sensed inside.  Any
attempts to channel the One Power outside the stedding have no effects
inside it.  The air inside the stedding seems different than that of
outside, fresher or more peaceful, causing most people to shiver in suprise
upon entering.  No Trolloc will enter a stedding unless driven, and even a
Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and will still be reluctant. 
Even Darkfriends, if truly dedicated, also feel uncomfortable and unwelcome
there.  The exact properties of a stedding are unknown.  

During the Breaking, the land and sea shifted so dramatically that all of
the stedding were swallowed up, leaving the Ogier homeless and wandering. 
Among the Ogier, this was known as the Exile.  The wandered the land looking
for their sanctuaries and after several years they began to Long for it. 
They Longed for the stedding so badly that they began to sicken and die. 
More Ogier died than not.  Since that time, Ogier do not leave the stedding
for extensive amounts of time.  If an Ogier stays Outside too long, the
Longing takes him and he will weaken.  If he does not return, he dies.  The
Ogier are bound to the stedding.  

The Ogier are known as wondrous stonemasons and when given free reign, tend
to make their stonework amazingly organic with buildings almost appearing to
be alive somehow.  Many of the great human cities, like Tar Valon, can still
boast Ogier built buildings.  Though marvelous stoneworkers, the Ogier feel
that it is beneath their abilities.  They love working with living and
growing things and have created groves all over the land, though most have
been torn down.  There is one Ogier grove that is well tended in Tar Valon
on the grounds of the White Tower.  Their second love is knowledge.  They
love to read and write and value books and records highly.  

Their clothing are often heavily embroidered, with women wearing embroidered
flowers in a quantitiy to suit their station.  Girls wear flowered trim only
on their cloaks, while women Elders' dresses are embroidered from throat to
ankle.  Necklaces and bracelets all reminiscent of leaves and vines are also
worn, but earrings are not.  Ogier ears are a secondary erogenous zone, and
are therefor kept partially covered by hair.  To bare them enough for
earrings would be to shocking.  All women wear their hair loose and long and
men wear theirs shorter than women.  Men's coats are various lengths, and
their shirts and trousers are plain.  Every aspect of clothing and jewelry
for both men and women reflects the profound Ogier respect for nature and
all living things.  

The Council is the only full time government within a stedding is aided by
other Ogier on particular projects when their skills are needed.  They use a
system of apprenticeship to train younger Ogier in responsibility and work
skills.  The apprentices only do menial tasks because that builds character.



The Ogier are almost a matriarchal society with the head of the Council
Elders a woman, and mothers and wives have more authority than their
husbands.  Marraiges are arranged by mothers, with the consent of the
bride-to-be, but the groom-to-be has no say-so.  A lot of young Ogier go to
work a bachelor and returned home to discover that he will be a groom the
next day.  

Ogier are typically peaceful by nature, though, it has been rumored that
they are indeed fierce fighters if provoked.

94 petshop~
In order to create a pet shop, you must first have two adjacent room
vnums.  For example's sake, let's use 100 and 101.  First, you need to go to
room 100 and edit it like you would any other.  For the room type, you
should set it as a pet shop by typing "room petshop".  Once the room is set,
the code is in for the room to sell pets.  Now, all you need is a mob reset
in this room.  This mob doesn't need to be a shopkeeper, just a mob in room
100 for the code to work from...  A pet keeper, if you will.  

Next, go to room 101.  This room will serve as a kennel and should not have
any exits.  You don't want players walking into this room and finding your
pets for two reasons.  One, because your pets should be rideable mobs (this
is done by setting the action, or "act rideable."  ) If a player were to
walk into your kennel, they would get a free ride.  Also, if they kill all
the pets in the room, other players will have to wait for a repop in order
to actually buy a pet.  

Anyway, in this room 101, you will want to reset all of the mobs that you
wish to use as pets.  When this is done, type "purge" and "edit room reset".
Looking at room 101, you should see one of each animal you wish to sell. 
Then, go back to room 100 and type "list".  A list of all the animals you
reset in room 101 should appear as buyable pets.  

Just a few notes about pet shops.  1.)  You can not adjust the price of a
pet.  The price is automatically set with the level of the pet.  The higher
the level, the more expensive the pet.  However, the longer it lives, so it
is worth it.  2.)  Pets are nice to have, they are also expensive.  Let's
not have a trillion pet shops for players to buy rides at...  The average
player wouldn't be able to afford a 50, 000 silver piece horse.  Only nobles
and merchants would be riding animals like that.  SO, I would like to set
the number of pet shops at one per area.  
 
That's all :) Keep building and have fun!

-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~
{DShadows{x of the Wheel offers a wide range of races as found in the Wheel
of Time.  Each race has it's unique base, as reflected in world of Robert
Jordan.  

Please see the help files for each race for detailed description of each
races uniquness (i.e. 'help andoran').  

~

-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers.  Humans may also train their primary stat higher than any other
race.
~

-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
Choice (add,drop,list,help)?~

-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~

-1 THIEF~
Thieves are a marginal class.  They do few things better than any other
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas
undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are
better fighters than channelers, but lack the wide weapon selection of
warriors.  

~

-1 WARRIOR~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of channelers.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

~

-1 WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER ARROW AXE DAGGER FLAIL LANCE MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP STAFF EXOTIC~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
arrow               the use of bows and arrows
axe                 the use of axes, ranging from hand to great
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
lance               the skill of using lances
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
staff               the skill which allows you to wield a staff
exotic              the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
 
SEE HELP ARCHERY for use of bow and arrow
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Skill Type: Passive, Defensive

The shield block skill allows attacks to be blocked with a shield, and has a
small chance of turning away an attack so well that you will gain a free
attack on your opponent.  

Beware; flails bypass shields, whips have an easier time getting around
them, and axes can destroy shields completely, but those with
better-than-average reflexes can mitigate some of these problems.  

Shield blocking can be turned off by removing your shield or with the
'autoshieldblock' command.  
~

-1 CREATION~
The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent
duration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their 
powers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in
this group, which contains these spells:

continual light	creates an eternal light source
create food	produces a nourishing mushroom
create rose	creates a beautiful red rose
create spring	calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground
create water	fills any available container with water
floating disc	creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure
~

-1 WEATHER~
These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~

0 BACKSTAB~
Skill Type: Active, Attacking
Command: backstab <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: No

The backstab skill allows someone to initiate combat with a strong,
stealthy attack, striking with each equipped weapon.  Attempting to backstab
a target will force them to attack you whether you succeed or not, though
targets who are hurt may be too wary of their surroundings for you to sneak
up behind them and attack.  Training this skill makes it more likely that
you will succeed and increases the damage you can deal.  
~

0 RIDE RIDING~
Skill Type: Active
Command: mount <target>
         call mount
         retire mount

The ride skill allows you to tame and ride a mount.  Training this skill
allows you to tame higher-level creatures to use as mounts.  

To tame a mount or start riding your current mount, enter 'mount <target>'. 
If the target cannot be used as a mount, a message will display indicating
so.  If the target can be used as a mount but is too high-level for your
skill, it will attack you, so be careful!  

The 'call mount' command is used to call your mount from wherever they are
to your side; you can use it after you recall to have your mount come with
you.  The 'retire mount' command is used to let your current mount go so
that you can search for another.  
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful characters can master berserking, the ability to enter
insane rage in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy
spell -- a huge surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for
personal safety.  Berserking characters are more resistant to the effects of
weaves.  
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~

0 DISARM~
Skill Type: Active
Command: disarm
Initiates Combat: No
Used In Combat: Yes

The disarm skill allows you to attack an opponent's weapon for the
purpose of knocking it out of their hands, limiting their combat options. 
Having knowledge of the weapon your opponent is using as well as your own
increases the chances of a successful disarm.  You can only disarm
the target you are currently focused on.

There are some weapons that cannot be removed, and the disarm skill will
automatically fail if your opponent holds one of these weapons.  
~

0 DODGE~
Skill Type: Passive, Defensive

If all else fails, get out of the way.  The dodge skill allows you to dodge
attacks in combat, if the attack has not already been blocked by a shield or
parried with a weapon.  

Dodging can be turned off with the 'autododge' command.  
~

0 'ENHANCED DAMAGE' ENHANCED~
Skill Type: Passive

The enhanced damage skill causes your attacks in combat to deal more damage
when striking with weapons or fists (not weaves).  The higher the skill, the
more likely the skill will trigger and the more damage you will do.  
~

0 WHIRLWIND~
Skill Type: Active, Attacking
Command: whirlwind <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: Yes

The whirlwind skill is used by warriors to attack multiple targets in
combat.  Training this skill increases the number of attacks that the
warrior has the potential to deal to each target.  Other players who are
grouped with you will not be targeted by this skill.  

One note: if you are engaged in combat with mobs but are not currently
tanking, you must use 'whirlwind <target>' to use the whirlwind skill; using
'whirlwind' without designating a target will not work.  
~

0 ALERTNESS AWARENESS OBSERVATION~
Skill Type: Passive

The alertness, awareness and observation skills allow players to find and
notice things that might otherwise be hidden from them.  Alertness increases
the likelihood of noticing sneaking players/mobs, awareness increases the
likelihood of seeing hidden players/mobs, and observation increases the
likelihood of seeing hidden objects/exits.  Training these skills gives more
of a chance for noticing the specific scenario each skill governs.  
~

0 NOTUSED5~
~

0 PARRY~
Skill Type: Passive, Defensive

The parry skill allows you to block attacks with an equipped weapon.  You
cannot parry if you do not have a weapon equipped.  Having knowledge of the
weapon your opponent is using against you as well as your own increases the
chances of a successful parry.  

Parrying can be turned off by removing or sheathing your weapon or with the
'autoparry' command.  
~

0 SAP~
Skill Type: Active, Attacking
Command: sap <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: No

The sap skill lets you attempt to strike another player or mob
unconscious, forcing them to sleep.  Players hit by this skill will not be
able to wake up for a few ticks until the sap effect wears off, while mobs
will remain sleeping; however, the target will immediately wake up if they
are attacked.  Training this skill makes it more likely that you will
successfully sap your target.  

Since the skill entails striking your target in the back of the head, it is
most easily done with a blunt weapon such as a mace or club.  Daggers carry
a slight penalty (striking the target with the hilt), and all other weapon
types carry a significant penalty.  

If you fail to sap your target, you will deal a small amount of damage to
them and they will immediately attack you, so be careful!  
~

0 'IRON WILL'~
Skill Type: Active, Buffing
Command: iron

The iron will skill allows a person to focus their mind on defense and
shrug off a small amount of damage, giving them a bonus to their armor. 
Training this skill makes it more likely to work, increases the bonus
received and the amount of time it lasts.  
~

0 'SECOND ATTACK' 'THIRD ATTACK' 'FOURTH ATTACK' 'FIFTH ATTACK' SECOND THIRD FOURTH FIFTH~
Skill Type: Passive

The second, third, fourth and fifth attack skills allows you to strike
multiple times in combat with your weapon, increasing the amount of damage
you can do.  Each subsequent skill increases the likelihood of the previous
skill working as well; for example, the third attack skill both increases
the chance of a second attack and makes it possible to get a third attack. 
Training these skills increases the likelihood of them and the skills before
them working.  

Because their lives are dedicated to fighting, warriors get access to all
four skills, while thieves and channelers have access to fewer attacks.  
~

0 NOTUSED11~
~

0 NOTUSED8~
~

0 'FAST HEALING' MEDITATION~
Skill Type: Passive

The fast healing and meditation skills increase the rate at which you regain
health and endurance respectively.  This applies to the natural regeneration
that occurs when walking around, resting or sleeping.  Combined with a
blanket or other item to sleep on, these can significantly reduce the time
it takes to regain health and endurance.  
~

0 NOTUSED9~
~

0 NOTUSED4~
~

0 PEEK~
Skill Type: Active
Command: peek <target>

The peek skill is used to see the inventory of a mob or player.  This is
usually used as a prelude to stealing from them.  Training this skill makes
it less likely that you will be caught at it and also gives more information
about what the target is carrying.  

Peeking at another player's inventory should only be done when both parties
are IC.  Be prepared to face the consequences if you abuse this skill or if
your target catches you while IC!  
~

0 TORNADO 'EARTHEN GRASP' 'ARROWS OF FIRE' 'MIND CRUSH' 'TIDAL WAVE'~
Weave Type: Active, Attacking
Spheres: {WAir{x / {yEarth{x / {RFire{x / {YSpirit{x / {BWater{x
Command:  cast tornado/earthen/arrows/'mind crush'/tidal <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: Yes

These five weaves are strong single-target weaves that deal a significant
amount of damage.  They are based solely on the Air, Earth, Fire, Spirit and
Water spheres respectively.  They can be cast once per round during combat. 
Training these weaves will increase the number of hits they will deal to
your target.  As they are effectively identical, it is recommended that you
get the weave that corresponds to your highest sphere to maximize your
damage.  
~

-1 NOTUSED2~
~

0 STEAL~
Skill Type: Active
Command: steal coins/<object> <target>

The steal skill allows you to steal money or items from mobs, shops and
players.  Only items in the inventory may be targeted.  Be careful, though;
mobs and especially shopkeepers are very careful with their items and you
could be caught and branded a thief, which will make life difficult for you.

Stealing against another player is an IC act, meaning that it should only be
done when both parties are IC.  Be prepared to face the consequences if you
abuse this skill or if your target catches you while IC!  
~

0 REVEAL~
Level: 55 

Syntax: c reveal

This weaves of {WAir{x, {RFire{x and {BWater{x creates a wind which disperses a fine
{Gglowing{x dust throughout the room.  As this dust settles, everyone within the
room will have their presence made known for a short period until the the
{Ys{Wp{Ya{Wr{Yk{Wl{Yi{Wn{Yg{x affect wears off.  
~

0 'HEAT METAL'~
Weave Type: Attacking
Spheres:  {RFire{x
Command: cast 'heat metal' <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: Yes

This weave targets any metal equipment that the target is wearing,
causing minor damage and potentially forcing the target to remove metal
armor and weapons that are affected (unless they are not able to be
removed).  Training this weave makes it more likely to work.  
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

This simple weaving of {YSpirit{w is one of the most useful and often overlooked
abilities of the channeler, as it can put an end to all violence in a room. 
Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a
disadvantage in combat as long as the weave soothes their minds.  The more
violence activity there is in a room, the harder the weave, and it is all or
nothing -- either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of
those who are immune to channeling) or none is.  
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.

94 for~
Super-AT command:
FOR ALL <action>
FOR MORTALS <action>
FOR GODS <action>
FOR MOBS <action>
FOR EVERYWHERE <action>
Executes action several times, either on ALL players (not including yourself),
MORTALS (including trusted characters), GODS (characters with level higher than
L_HERO), MOBS (Not recommended) or every room (not recommended either!)
If you insert a # in the action, it will be replaced by the name of the target.
If # is a part of the action, the action will be executed for every target
in game. If there is no #, the action will be executed for every room containg
at least one target, but only once per room. # cannot be used with FOR EVERY-
WHERE. # can be anywhere in the action.
Example:
 
FOR ALL SMILE -> you will only smile once in a room with 2 players.
FOR ALL TWIDDLE # -> In a room with A and B, you will twiddle A then B.
Destroying the characters this command acts upon MAY cause it to fail. Try to
avoid something like FOR MOBS PURGE (although it actually works at my MUD).
FOR MOBS TRANS 3054 (transfer ALL the mobs to Midgaard temple) does NOT work
though :)
The command works by transporting the character to each of the rooms with
target in them. Private rooms are not violated.

0 FORSAKEN CHOSEN~
The Forsaken is the name commonly given to the thirteen most powerful Aes
Sedai who turned to the Shadow.  Among themselves they were known as "Those
Chosen to Rule the World Forever" or simply "The Chosen."  

Not a great deal is known about any of the Forsaken.  One thing that is very
clear, however, is that the Forsaken schemed against each other as much as
against the forces which opposed the Dark One.  Each one of the Forsaken
strove to be named Naeblis, a goal which each desired since turning to the
Shadow.  To be named Naeblis was to be the Great Lords Regent on Earth.  The
person named Naeblis would be only a step below the Dark One himself, ruling
over all else.  

Other Aes Sedai joined the Shadow during the War of Power, some nearly as
powerful as the Forsaken.  However, by the end of the war, none of these Aes
Sedai were still alive; no records show any of them having been killed by
the enemy.  

All of the Forsaken, with the apparent exception of Ishamael, were
completely trapped inside the Dark Ones prison when the Bore was sealed. 
The other Forsaken trapped in the Bore were Demandred, Aginor, Balthamel,
Asmodean, Sammael, Rahvin, Belal, Lanfear, Mesaana, Graendal, Semirhage, and
Moghedien.  

Since being released from the Bore, the Forsaken have attempted to establish
themselves in positions which will be beneficial for both themselves and
{rthe Great Lord of the Dark{x.

0 ICTITLE~
Syntax: ictitle <string>
Syntax: ictitle reset
 
IC titles are considered to be in-character and to reflect your current
dressing, or as an extention to your appearance. All characters start off
with a blank 'ictitle', but it free to change this to fit into your RP.
 
Remember that your current doing always will be following after your ICtitle.
Therefore always leave your itcitle without a '.' at the end.
 
ICtitles will show as: (Flag) (Name) <Appearance> <ICtitle> <Doing>.
 
ICtitle reset will reset your current ictitle to a totally blank string.

0 ANGREAL TER'ANGREAL TERANGREAL SA'ANGREAL SAANGREAL~
Aes Sedai often bemoan the fact that so much knowledge has been lost
since the Age of Legends.  What once was commonplace is now unheard of.  But
more than knowledge was lost during the Breaking of the World - many angreal
have been lost over time.  

Angreal increase the amount of the One Power that an Aes Sedai can channel. 
Some angreal are quite small, almost appearing to have been made as gifts,
while others give the user more substantial gains.  

Again illustrating the differences between saidar and saidin, the angreal
which work for men do nothing for women and vice versa.  A woman holding an
angreal attuned to a woman feels a sort of warmth from the angreal.  The
same woman holding a male angreal will feel nothing.  

Angreal are not to be confused with ter'angreal, which were created to use
the Power in a specific manner.  Several of the known ter'angreal are
doorways or arches which some how transport the person who enters to a place
or time which appears to be quite real.  The White Tower has such a
structure with three archs which is used to test Novices who hope to gain
Acceptance.  This ter'angreal is activated using the One Power, following a
set ceremony for the process.  The Novice is made to face her worst fears,
first for her past, second for her present, and third for her future.  In
the Waste, in Rhuidean, a similar ter'angreal is used to show the Wise Women
possible futures.  The White Tower also contains the closely guarded
ter'angreal which they call the Oath Rod.  

While rare, angreal and ter'angreal are not as rare as the even more
powerful sa'angreal, which are virtually unheard of.  Angreal are extremely
valuable, and the White Tower is extremely careful about who uses them and
where they are at all times.

0 BALEFIRE~
Weave Type: Attacking
Command: cast balefire <target>

The balefire weave utterly destroys the target, burning its thread from
the Pattern.  The target is irrevocably dead, and everything they were
wearing or carrying is destroyed as well.  

Now that you know that, here are the rules:

- The balefire weave is a granted weave ONLY.  It will only be given to
people involved in an IMM-driven RP and only for good reason.  Do not bother
asking for it.  Repeated attempts at asking for it may gain a quick look at
it for a brief moment.  

- Balefiring a player is an IC act, and it must be agreed upon by both
parties OOCly (because the target will be quite dead afterwards).  In
addition, permission must be obtained from the IMMs before balefiring a
player.  Failure to follow these rules will result in the player doing so
being {RDELETED{x.  There is only one exception to this rule; if the target is
known ICly as a Forsaken, you do not need OOC permission from the player of
the Forsaken character to target them, but the other parts of the rule (must
be IC and require permission from the IMMs) still apply.  

- Balefiring a player will have IC ramifications and must be RPed
accordingly, as balefire removes their thread from the Pattern and can
reverse recent actions.  Consult with the IMM who provided permission to use
the weave on what the consequences of the balefire will be based on the RP. 

All uses of balefire will be closely monitored.  Do not abuse it.  
~

0 CALLANDOR~
Callandor is the name given to the crystal sword that is actually one of
the greatest saangreal ever made.  During the Breaking of the World it was
hidden and shielded within the Stone of Tear to prevent its use by the
maddened male Aes Sedai.  The prophecies stated that it would eventually be
claimed by the Dragon Reborn.  

The fall of the Stone of Tear and the claiming of Callandor were considered
to be two of the greatest signs that the Dragon had been Reborn.  

Callandor is an extremely powerful saangreal, among the greatest ever made. 
Perhaps only the two great saangreal originally constructed to seal the Dark
Ones prison are more powerful.  

But there are several problems inherent in the use of Callandor.  First, few
would even have the skill to handle the large flow of saidin the sword can
command.  Enough saidin could be channeled through this saangreal to level
an entire city.  

The greatest danger, though, comes from Callandor itself.  It is not
buffered in the same manner that other great saangreal were buffered.  As
such, the use of Callandor lends the user to believe that he can do
anything.  The more a man uses Callandor, the more this lack of a buffer
becomes apparent.  Callandor also magnifies the taint of saidin.  

But Callandor can safely be used under certain conditions.  A circle of one
man and two women, with one of the women leading, could safely wield
Callandor.  The current mistrust between Ashaman and Aes Sedai, though,
makes it unlikely that any such circle could be attempted.

~

0 'ALIGN MATRIX' ALIGN MATRIX 'EARTH SINGING'~
The Talent of Aligning the Matrix was thought to be lost.  This Talent
strengthens metal items significantly.  It was part of the process used to
create Power-wrought weapons.  The process can increase the hardness of a
weapon, or even make it unbreakable.  
~

0 'CLOUD DANCING' CLOUD DANCING 'WEAVING OF WIND'~
A person with this Talent can affect and shift the local weather.  A
person with this Talent may find it easy to make it rain, sleet, snow,
hailstorm, thunderstorm, dust storm, tornado, blizzard, or even hurricane. 
However, the channeler is limited by if if the weather is appropriate for
the season, and they have no control over how the weather acts once they
have directed it in the desired way.  The effects of altering the weather
tend to keep going along whichever lines the channeling formed them into. 
This Talent is cultivated by the Sea Folk Windfinders who refer to it as the
Weaving of Winds.  
~

0 DELVING~
Related to Healing, this is the use of the One Power to examine a person
for illness or injury.  
~

0 DREAMING~
The ability to enter Tel'aran'rhiod from one's sleep.  This is a rare
Talent that is not connected to the One Power or the ability to channel. 
(ACoS, Ch10) The Wise Ones believe that male dreamwalkers are extremely
rare.  (ACoS, Ch10)

Aes Sedai have studied the phenomenon of Dreamers having visions within
their dreams which seem to tell of future events.  These visons are not as
certain to come true as with a Fortelling, but scholars believe they may
indicate possible future events.  (WOWOT) 
~

0 FORETELLING FORETELL~
The ability to see part of the Pattern.  Very rare.  It is closely linked
with Dreaming.  (TGH, Ch12) Elaida a'Roihan, Gitara Moroso and Nicola
Treehill have the Talent.  Although always true, Foretellings are often very
difficult to interpret.  See Prophecies for specific Foretellings.  

Some with the Talent only have one or two visions in their lifetime.  Linked
to the One Power, only those who can channel may have a Foretelling. 
(WOWoT) 
~

0 KEEPING~
A weave that protects a perishable object and keeps it permanently
 fresh. (WH,Ch12)
~

0 RESIDUE RESIDUES~
All channelers can detect the residue of weavings, but some have this
 ability so refined that they can read and duplicate a weaving as
 much as two days after it has dissipated. (TPoD,Ch2) 
~

0 SENSE_TAVEREN~
The ability to sense that someone is ta'veren. Rare. Siuan Sanche,
 Logain and Nicola Treehill have this talent. Alar, the Eldest Elder
 of Stedding Tsofu, also can sense ta'veren.
~

0 SNIFFING~
You can smell the psychic residue left by violent acts and follow
 the trails of the characters or creatures that committed them.
 To your nose, these acts of violence give a foul odor. The power
 and intensity of the odor give you some sense of the magnitude of
 the violence, how recently it occurred, or both.
~

0 TRAVELING TRAVEL~
The ability to open a gateway directly from one location to another. 
Anyone of sufficient strength and knowledge can Travel.  Traveling requires
detailed knowledge of the place one is Traveling from.  Gaining sufficient
knowledge takes several hours.  (ACoS, Ch9) However, when Traveling a very
short distance almost no knowledge is needed.  (ACoS, Ch41) It is not
necessary to face the direction that you want to Travel, but for some, it
helps.  (TPoD, Ch21) 
~

0 TREE_SINGING 'TREE SINGING' TREE SINGING~
An ability of the Ogier race to sing to trees, making them grow straight
and tall.  It also imparts the ability to heal trees, and most importantly,
sing wood from them.  This process obtains objects made from the living wood
that are without seams or crafting marks, and does not harm the tree in
their making.  The geriatric effect among Ogier is similar to the effect
channeling has among humans.  
~

0 UNWEAVING~
The ability to take apart a One Power weave as opposed to letting it
 fade naturally. Aviendha and some of the Wise Ones have this ability,
 but it is unknown to the Aes Sedai. (TPoD,Ch2) 
~

0 VIEWING~
You see auras and sometimes prophetic images around people.  You see a
faint aura around a person that indicates one unknown, important, or
unconfirmed fact about the subject's personality or his/her role in your
life or the events that surround you.  Sometimes you may get strong images
that are often metaphoric.  
~

0 WOLFKIN~
Very few humans are aware of new abilities, thought by some to be Old
Talents, some which have little or nothing to do with the One Power.  The
ability to sense the presence of wolves and to speak to the wolves mentally
in a sort of image language is one of these.  

Those who have this talent, sometimes called Wolfbrothers or Wolfkin, risk a
certain type of madness and insanity.  Developing Wolfbrother abilities too
fast has a great impact on the risk of madness.  Slow integration allows one
to deal with the changes in the body and mind.  These changes are a product
of the wolf-like animal urges which may overwhelm the Wolfbrother's human
side.  As a result of this process, Wolfbrothers possess several distinctive
physical features.  Their eyes turn a shade of golden-yellow, their beards
and hair grow more quickly and thickly, and their face becomes a little
longer and sharper, somtimes with little points developing on the tips of
the ears.  

Aside from the physical results of the change, Wolfbrothers also have a
heightened senses, such as smell.  Some Wolfbrothers claim they are able to
tell some emotions by scent, such as fear.  Also they have the ability to
enter what is known as the Wolf Dream, which is known to others as
Tel'aran'rhiod.

0 ACUTE_SENSE ACUTE_SENSES 'ACUTE SENSE' 'ACUTE SENSES'~
Some creatures have exceptionally sharp hearing, smelling, and vision
skills.  Over the years, civilization has dulled the awareness of most
humans, but a few remain with the keen senses of their animal brethren.  
~

0 AMBIDEXTROUS~
You are capable of using either hand with near equal proficiency.  
~

0 CALM_HEART~
You are calm and composed even when others of your kind would normally not be.
~

0 CONCENTRATION~
You have the ability to focus even with distractions all around you.
~

0 FAST_LEARNER SLOW_LEARNER~
As a fast learner, you find learning and training a bit easier than most
others would.  Sometimes, gaining knowledge can throw you an extra bonus,
since you often see a relationship between learning.  

As a slow learner, you find learning and training a bit harder than most
others would.  Sometimes learning can take longer or cost more than a normal
training.  
~

0 HUGE_SIZE~
You are abnormally large in size, possibly over seven feet tall and 400
pounds in weight.  This allows you to sustain more damage and to carry on
when the average person would be incapacitated.  However, your tremendous
bulk does come with a cost of higher than normal endurance usage.  
~

0 LONGWINDED~
Most people get tired while fighting or doing tasks that require
endurance.  You, however, find these tasks less difficult.  You can keep
going when others would need a break.  
~

0 PERFECT_BALANCE~
You have been blessed with an incredible sense of balance that makes it
difficult to be thrown out of equilibrium.  
~

0 QUICK_REFLEXES SLOW_REFLEXES~
With quick reflexes, your reflexes seem to develop better and faster than
most normal people with your abilities.

With slow reflexes, your reflexes develop far slower and not quite as well
as most normal people with your abilities.  
~

0 STEALTHY~
From a young age, you have learned to move with your surroundings. 
Sometimes, if you have learned well enough, you can even vanish into the
surroundings and conceal your presence from others.  
~

0 TOUGH WEAK~
When it comes to taking pain, you have the edge.  You can tolerate far
more hits than a normal person.  

The weak flaw is the tough counter part.  You just can not stand pain.  
~

0 EFFICIENT~
When compared to the average channeler, channelers with this merit find
themselves less tired when they combine flows.  
~

0 INEFFICIENT~
Channelers with this flaw find combining flows into a weave more draining
than most others would with the same abilities.  
~

0 INEPT~
While you may not be stupid, you are not in tune with your natural
abilities.  This will have a random effect each time your -natural-
abilities would be used.  
~

0 ILLITERATE~
You are unable to read and write.  Any ability involving written works is
beyond you.  
~

0 ONE_ARM~
You have only one arm.  This could be a battle scar, birth defect or
other form of injury.  It is assumed that you are accustomed to using your
remaining hand, so you suffer no off-hand penalty.  However, tasks requiring
two hands normally are much more difficult for you.  
~

0 SHORT~
You are well below average height, and have trouble seeing over high
objects and moving quickly.  In some circumstances, this will give you a
concealment bonus.  You will, however, be limited in what you can dual wield
and will have difficulties with skills involving reach.  Parry would be one
example skill affected by being short.  

~

0 MERIT MERITS FLAW FLAWS TALENT TALENTS~
During character creation you will have the option to select merits,
flaws and talents that will be unique for your character.  

A merit is something that add to your character abilities, while a flaw
takes away from your abilities.  

Talents are special abilities that can give access to a wide range of new
skills or weaves that those not so talented can't access.

0 PC_SPHERE_MENU~
All channelers start with a basis sphere potential for each of the five
spheres.  You are allowed to use a given amount of points to adjust your
spheres up and down according to what would fit the character best.  

The rank in the spheres identify your potential in each of the five spheres.
A higher rank means you have a higher potential in that sphere.  

Spheres can be set from rank 1 to rank 10, where 1 identify a weak potential
and 10 a great potential.  

Setting a sphere rank low/high will affect both how well you can combine
flows and how strong it will be.  

You may also set one of the five spheres as your main sphere.  This will
give you an edge in flows that greatly require this flow.  It will also give
you a additional bonus in your potential.

0 SEAL~
Syntax: seal <gateway>

The 'seal' command is used to seal an open gateway.  It has been proven that
sealing a gateway that is woven by one self is far easier than sealing a
gateway woven by another and perhaps stronger channeler.
 
(See also: GATE, TRAVELING)
~

0 TOKEN TOKENWHERE~
Level: 30

Syntax: cast token <id-key number>
Syntax: tokenwhere <id-key number>
 
Those channelers that posess both the knowledge and abilties can combine
flows of {yEarth{w and {YSpirit{w into a token. A token is a small but simple weave
that is attached to a object, mostly used a coin. Given to a person you
are able to track this persons direction as long as he keep the coin
on him or here.
 
The <id-key number> is a unique key value that you can use to separet two
or more token from each other.
 
The 'tokenwhere' command use the assigned id-key number and try to sense
where your token is located, unless it's lost.
~

0 STILLING~
The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who can channel
from the One Power.  A woman who has been stilled can sense the True Source,
but she cannot touch it.  So seldom has it been done that novices are
required to learn the names and crimes of all who have suffered it. 
Officially, stilling is the result of trial and sentence for a crime.  When
it happens accidentally, it is called being burned out.  In practice, the
term "stilling" is often used for both.  Women who have been stilled,
however it occurred, seldom survive long; they seem to simply give up and
die unless they find something to replace the emptiness left by the One
Power.  While it has always been believed that stilling was permanent,
lately a method of {rHealing{x it has been discovered, though there appear to be
limits to this which are yet to be explored.  

See also '{WHelp Gentling{x' for male terminology.
~

0 GENTLING GENTLE~
The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel
from the One Power.  This is necessary because any man who learns to channel
will go insane from the taint on saidin and will almost certainly do
horrible things with the Power in his madness.  A man who has been gentled
can still sense the True Source, but he cannot touch it.  Whatever madness
has come before gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured
by it, and if it is done soon enough death can be averted.  A man who is
gentled, however, inevitably gives up wanting to live; those who do not
succeed in committing suicide usually die anyway within a year or two.  One
believed permanent, gentling is now known by some to be susceptible to a
highly specialized form of Healing.

0 TEACH~
Syntax: teach <player> [amount] <skill/weave>

The '{Wteach{x' command allows you to share your knowledge in a skill or weave
with other players.  To be able to teach another player, he or she needs to
be in your group.  

Teaching yourself is, by code definition, a means of practicing something by
yourself until you need help from others, or have it at a level that is
sufficient for you.  

Teaching others or teaching yourself costs both experience points and trains
for the one receiving the knowledge.  

If you are going to teach skills or weaves it must be done icly.  

You must rp that they are learning a skill/weave and you should not be
training more than 1 point per session.  Sessions should be of a good length
to cover neccesary practice time.  I would suggest 20 minuets real time
atleast.  

Now if you are going to teach someone the mastery forms.  BladeMaster,
Duelling, or SpearDancer.  You are not a master of your weapon until you
have been given the mastery weapon.  Most people do not want to be taught
from an amature as they will get incomplete or wrong teachings.  

Now that doesn't mean you cant practice together and the 1 person could then
increase the other abuility, but you can not claim a pupil as your teacher. 


There are players that are masters in each catagory of mastery weapons.  So
if you really are looking for a teacher they are out there to find, and
there is the mobs that you can still teach you if you dont want to rp the
act.

$n/$N - Your/<target> name or appearance
$e/$E - he/she/it
$m/$M - him/her/it
$s/$S - his/her/its
 
The lowercase tags are for you and the uppercase tags are for your target.
 
Example:
emoteto sedai notices $N here and $e bows to $M deeply.
 
The target would see:
<YOU> notices you here and he bows to you deeply.
 
Everyone else would see:
<YOU> notices <TARGET> here and he bows to her deeply.

0 ENTICE~
The few humans that have developed the wolfkin talent are able to sense
other wolves.  These wolves can become powerful allies, if the entice skill
is learned.  

The entice skill will send out images to all wolves within reach and call
for their assistance.  Those strong in the talent and skill are able to
summon more than one wolf to assist in their aid.  
~

0 WKNAME~
Syntax: wkname <name>

The wkname command allows those who have developed the wolfkin talent to
name themselves among the wolves.  The wkname will be what the other wolves
know you as.  

Colors are allowed to be used in the wkname.

Once a wkname is set, it can no be changed, unless agreed with the immortals
~

0 WKL 'WOLFKIN LIST' WKT 'WOLFKIN TALK'~
Syntax: wkl
{w        wkt <message>

WKL - the wolfkin list command will try to sense other of your wolfkin, and
list them by wolfkin name or wkname.  

WKT - the wolfkin talk command will allow you to communicate with the other
of your wolfkin over a special channel.

0 Trolloc Trollocs ~
The Trolloc was and is certainly large and powerful.  Standing eight
to;ten feet in height, with the body of an overlarge, extremely muscular
man, they were strong than either human or animal part of heritage and as
fast as a horse.  Vicious by nature, they manifested plenty be ferociety,
killing for no other reason than the pure pleasure of it.  And their size
and strength made them extremely difficult to kill.  However, Trollocs
simply do not have the discipline, or the ability to take orders, that
characterizes an efficient soldier.  They had the instincts and;drives of
animals combined with the worst human characteristics and very limited (by
human standards) level of intelligence.  Their towering coarse-haired bulky
forms loomed over any human, while intelligent eyes glared evilly out from
faces that often bore horns or tusks, and bestial muzzles full of gnashing
teeth, or snapping sharp beaks.  Some even had the hind legs of the animal
they resembled, with hooves or claws in place of feet, though almost all had
humanlike hands with thick, heavy nails- the better to carry their deadly
weapons.  And if they lacked a soldier's true discipline, sheer numbers made
up for a great deal.

0 CAMOUFLAGE~
SYNTAX : camouflage
The camouflage skill works upon the same principal as hide, but can be
used only in natural surroundings.  This skill represents one's ability to
blend in with nature.  To use this skill the character must not be within a
city or building 
~

0 GUILD GUILDS CLAN CLANS~
1) Four players are required to start a new guild, and must stay active
for a guild to continue to stay open.  To petition for a new guild, the four
players need to note to guild admin, in the guild note area.  This does not
guarantee that the guild will be opened, and will be at the discretion of
the admin.  Subguilds will subsequently be opened on an as needed basis.  

2) Guild leaders rank 1-3 must log on for a minimum of five hours per week,
being visible to the guild and the mud for guild matters and RP.  If the
guild leader is going to be away from the mud, a note to the guild and guild
admin explaining the absense is expected.  While this is the minimum time,
attention will be paid to the following rule as well.  

3) Guild leaders rank 1-2 must play their leader character as their primary
character, or risk losing not only the position, but that character.  This
does not mean that guildleaders may not play alts, but if the admin notices
that the guild leader is neglecting their guild leader alt for another alt,
then the admin may choose for something untoward to happen to the guild
leader to allow others more willing to put time and RP into the position to
have a chance at it.  
 
* Guilds thrive when their leaders are logging on and taking an active role
in the guild.  Guild leaders have a responsibility toward this end, and
shirking it may cause the player to lose the guild leader position, as well
as their character.  
 
4) A person with a guild leader character (guild level 1-3) may not have his
or her alt(s) raise any higher than guild level 4.  
 
5) Guild leaders rank 1-2 may not be absence for more than 2 weeks without
notice.

0 'DUAL WIELD'~
Skill Type: Active
Command: dual <weapon>

The dual wield skill allows a second weapon to be wielded in the
off-hand, though the weapon must be of equal or lighter weight.  Training
this skill makes it more likely that off-hand attacks will succeed.  Those
unfortunate enough to have only one arm are unable to use this skill.

Wielding two weapons increases the number of attacks you deal during combat
as well as with some combat skills such as backstab, and also increases the
likelihood of attacks being parried because you have two weapons with which
to try.  However, this comes at the cost of being unable to wear a shield or
hold an item in addition to your weapons, preventing the use of the shield
block skill.  

If you are disarmed while dual-wielding, you will automatically switch your
off-hand weapon to your main hand in order to continue fighting.

is well-mannered, has an interesting sense of humor and most days, can be
found laughing at his own jokes.  But beware, he also describes himself as

94 HITROLL~
The hitroll should be the mob's level, minus ten. For example:

Level     Hitroll
10         0
20        10
30        20
40        30
50        40

If your mob is level 10 or lower, the hitroll should be 0.
~

94 ARMOR_G1~
These are guidelines for armor.  None of them are set in stone, but if
you chose to stray from them, please have a reason to do so.  

Armor should be set at the same level as the mob that is wearing it.  

Don't set a piece of armor with everything from the "extra" flag.  Each
piece should be unique and should do something different.  Weapons with
several "extras" should be quest weapons.  

When creating a piece of armor, you have a number of points equal to the
level of the armor.  These points should be distributed thoughout the armor
class values for the weapon: pierce (v0), bash (v1), slash (v2) and exotic
(v3).  For example: 

A level 20 piece of equipment has 20 points to distribute.  Here are some of
the combinations.  

pierce 20 bash 0 slash 0 exotic 0
pierce 5 bash 5 slash 5 exotic 5
pierce 10 bash 0 slash 0 exotic 10

Finally, earrings and rings.  No matter what level they are, they should
have ac levels of 0.  In other words, pierce, bash, slash and exotic should
all be 0.  Or, they should be set as type "treasure" instead of "armor." 
The protection of these items in a battle would be nil and therefore, to
keep it real, please abide by this rule.  
~

94 'AREA COSTS'~
These are suggestions and should be altered depending on the area, the
object and the builder.  

Remember that necessities should be less expensive than luxuries.
 
{WCLOTHING{x
(should be commensurate with type of clothing)
 
newbie clothes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  0

Weapons should cost between 150 and 350 depending on material and
craftsmanship.
 
{WFOOD{x
(should be commensurate with food hours)

a loaf of bread, a pie, a piece of fruit, candy . . . 10-15 gold
                                and should last . . .  2-4 hours

hunk of meat or cheese, a meal, rations . . . . . . . 15-25 gold
                                and should last . . .  4-6 hours

barrels of drink . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  250 gold 
 
{WLIGHTS/LANTERNS{x
(should be commensurate with light time)

a torch . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 gold
                            and should last (v2) . . .  2 hours

a lantern . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  100 gold
                            and should last (v2) . . .  5 hours

A light that never goes out should be set with a v2 of -1. These
types of lights should be expensive or found on higher level mobs.
 
{WWATER/CANTEENS{x
(should be commensurate with how much the container/fountain holds)

a small canteen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60-70 gold
                           and should hold (v0) . . . 5-6 drinks

a large canteen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 120-140 gold
                           and should hold (v0) . . 10-12 drinks

A fountain or a never-ending canteen (which should only be a quest
item) should have the v0 and v1 values of 100000. This way, they
never run out.
 
{WMOBS{x

The amount of gold carried by a mob should be determined by the 
type of mob it is. Animals, trollocs and fades should not carry 
gold. Other mobs can be separated into other categories: poor, 
working-class, middle-class and wealthy. As an estimation, areas 
should be 30% poor, 30% working-class, 25% middle-class and 15% 
wealthy mobs.
 
Examples:
A street urchin or a beggar is poor
A farmer, sailor, drunk or soldier is working class
A shop keep might be middle class
A mayor or a noble would be wealthy
 
Mob             Carried On Person     If Killed At Home
Poor            0-5 gold              0-15 gold
Working-class   0-15 gold             0-30 gold
Middle-class    0-25 gold             0-45 gold
Wealthy         0-50 gold             0-150 gold
Royalty         < 200 gold            < 200 gold
Shopkeepers     < 5000 gold

Please be logical about the weight values you give weapons. Swords
should not weight 10-15. Like everything else, we are trying to stay
true to the books.
 
Also, like armor, please do not set the weapon with all the "extra"
flags. Each weapon should be unique and do individual things.

94 BUILD_MOB~
In order to create a mob, you begin by typing:

{W"medit create <vnum>"{x - vnum refers to a vnum you have been assigned that is
not currently being used for another mobile.  

After you have typed this command, hit "enter" and your mob's information
will show on the screen.  

{WName:{x type in the names you wish your mobile to be known by.  (i.e. tall man
green) 

{WArea:{x This section automatically lists your area number and name.  

{WAct{x: This section automatically lists [npc].  For other act commands, type
"?  Act" (Hint: sentinel means the mob will not leave the room.)  

{WVnum:{x This number should be the number you typed in to create the mob.  

{WSex:{x Give your mob a gender.  Leave [none] or type in male, female or
either.  

{WGroup:{x Leave blank.  

{WLevel:{x Assign your mob any level 1-100.  

{WAlign{x: Evil: -1000 to -350, Neutral: -349 to 349, Good: 350 to 1000.

{WSphere:{x This number should only be set for mobs that can channel.  Set it by
typing in 5 consecutive numbers for air, earth, fire, spirit and water,
respectively.  These values can be any number you wish, within reason. 
(i.e. 5 10 8 8 15) 

{WRace:{x Type "?  Race" for available races.  If the race you desire is not
listed, leave it [unique].  

{WSize:{x Your options are tiny, small, medium, large, huge and giant.  

{WMaterial:{x Flesh for anything fleshy.  Otherwise, be creative.  

{WWealth:{x See "help costs" - under the mob section.  

{WStart pos.  :{x Type "?  Pos" for available options.

should have no punctuation unless it is an apostrophe.  

{WLong descr:{x A long description of your mob.  (i.e. A tall, green man strolls
casually down the street.)  This is what your players will see when they
enter the room.  The long desc should begin with a capital and end with a
period.  In other words, it should read like a sentence.  

{WDescription:{x What does your mob look like when someone looks at it?  

To finish, type "done" and you will leave the mob editor.  Remember to save
your area by typing "asave area"

PLEASE NOTE: These are guidelines for building mobiles on TSW.  Hit dice,
damage dice, endurance dice, sphere, armor class, etc.  Can vary from the
TSW standard as long as it is within reason.  We don't want invincible level
50 monsters running around out there.  Just use common sense and make each
mobile unique to its race, class, etc.  And, as always, if you have a
question, don't hesitate to ask.  This help is designed as a teaching tool
to get you started.  

Happy building!  
~

94 BUILD_OBJ~
In order to create a obj, you begin by typing:

"oedit create <vnum>" - vnum refers to a vnum you have been assigned that is
not currently being used for another object.  

After you have typed this command, hit "enter" and your obj's information
will show on the screen.  

{WName:{x Type in the names you wish your obj to be known by.  (i.e. yummy piece
chocolate) 

{WArea:{x This section automatically lists your area number and name.  

{WVnum:{x This number should be the number you typed in to create the obj.  

{WType:{x Type "?  Type" for available options.  Also, see "help build_types"

{WLevel:{x Assign your obj any level 1-100.

Otherwise, set value accordingly.  

{WWeight:{x How much does your object weight?  

{WCost:{x See "help cost" for some standard values.  Otherwise, just be
reasonable.  

{WShort descr:{x A short description of your obj.  (i.e. a yummy piece of
chocolate) The short desc should have no capital letters unless it is a
proper noun and it should have no punctuation unless it is an apostrophe.  

{WLong descr:{x A long description of your obj.  (i.e. A yummy piece of
chocolate melts in the middle of the road.)  This is what your players will
see when they enter the room.  The long desc should begin with a capital and
end with a period.  In other words, it should read like a sentence.  

To finish, type "done" and you will leave the obj editor.  Remember to save
your area by typing "asave area" 
~

94 BUILD_TYPES~
{WOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT TYPES{x

When you select certain types, more code will come up, asking you to supply
more information about the obj you are creating.  The following is a guide
to help you with this information.  

Type{W light{x: v2 = light hours.  A light that never goes out should be set
with a value of -1.  

Type{W scroll{x: v0 = level; v1, v2, v3, v4 = spells (Each one can be set with a
different spell.  Up to four different spells can go off with one scroll.) 


Type{W wand{x: v0 = level; v1 = charges total; v2 = charges left; v3 = spell
Type {wstaff{x: v0 = level; v1 = charges total; v2 = charges left; v3 = spell

Type {Wweapon{x: v0 = weapon class ("?  Wclass" for available weapons); v1 =
number of dice ("help weapons_g1" for TSW standard); v2 = type of dice
("help weapons_g1" for TSW standard); v3 = ?  Damtype for options; v4 =
special type ("?  Wtype" for available weapon types.  Please use these
sparingly.)  

Type {Warmor{x: v0 = ac pierce; v1 = ac bash; v2 = ac slash; v3 = ac exotic. 
For standard armor, you have a number of points equal to the level of the
armor to spread between the four ac values.  (i.e. A level 20 piece of armor
has a value of 20 to distribute.  So, pierce 5, bash 5, slash 5, exotic 5. 
Or, pierce 10, bash 5, slash 5, exotic 0.  Or, pierce 0, bash 10, slash 10,
exotic 0.  Etc.)  

Type {Wpotion{x: v0 = level; v1, v2, v3, v4 = spells (Each one can be set with a
different spell.  Up to four different spells can go off with one potion.) 


Type {Wfurniture{x: v0 = max people allowed on furniture; v1 = max weight
allowed on furniture; v2 = furniture flags (type "?  Furniture" for
availability); v3 = heal (how many hp the furniture will heal a player when
they use it); v4 = endur (how much endurance the furniture will heal a
player when they use it.)  

Type {Wcontainer{x: v0 = weight (if you are going to put an obj in the
container, make sure the weight of the container is more than the weight of
the obj you are putting into it); v1 = flags (type "?  Container" for
availability); v2 = key (the vnum of a key that opens your container if you
plan to have it lock); v3 = capacity (number of objs/people allowed in the
container); v4 = weight mult.  Type drinkcontainer: v0 = liquid total
(100000 if you never want it to run out.  Use this number sparingly); v1 =
liquid left; v2 = liquid (type "?  Liquid" for different types); v3 =
poisoned (your options are yes or no).  

Type{W food{x: v0 = food hours (how many ticks the food will last before player
sees hunger); v1 = full hours (how many ticks the player will be full for. 
This number should be greater than the v0 value); v3 = poisoned (your
options are yes or no.)  

Type {Wmoney{x: v0 = gold, v1 = silver.  

Type {Wfountain{x: v0 = liquid total (100000 if you never want it to run out);
v1 = liquid left; v2 = liquid (type "?  Liquid" for availability.)  

Type {Wpill{x: v0 = level: v1, v2, v3, v4 = spells (Each one can be set with a
different spell.  Up to four different spells can go off with one pill.)  

Type {Wportal{x: v0 = charges (number of times it can be used); v1 = exit flags
(type "?  Exit" for availability); v2 = portal flags (type "?  Portal" for
availability"); v3 = goes to vnum; v4 = key vnum (to be used if a key
triggers or unlocks the portal.)  
~

94 BUILD_ROOM~
In order to begin building, you should have received an area name and a
set of vnums to use.  Each of these vnums can be used to build a room, a mob
and an obj.  For example, let's use vnum 123.  There is a room with vnum
123, a mob with vnum 123, and a obj with vnum 123.  

To start your area, you'll need to create a room.  Use the first vnum you
have been given and type the following command: "redit create vnum" (i.e.
"redit create 123") 

By typing the command, the code will put you in room 123 and open the room
editor for you.  If you hit the "enter" key, you will see the room editor. 
If you chose to finish now, type "done" and the editor will close.  To
reopen it, simply type "edit room" and you are set to build your room again.

{WName:{x What do you wish your room to be called?  (i.e. An Open Field) Always
use capital letters when naming a room.  

{WArea{x: This section should list your area number and name already.  

{WVnum:{x This number is the vnum of the room you are editing.  

{WSector{x: Type "?  Sector" for available options.  Be sure to set your sector
as it effects the weather a player sees in a room and also the amount of
endurance used to traverse the area.  (i.e. A sector set as inside prevents
a player from seeing rain.)  

{WRoom flags:{x Type "?  Room" for available options.  (Hint: set room indoors
AND sector inside so that weather does not show in a building.)  

{WHeal rec:{x How many hit points will a player receive while in this room
during ticks?  We usually keep this value at 100 (the default) 

{WEnd rec:{x How many endurance points will a player receive while in this room
during ticks?  We usually keep this value at 100 (the default) 

{WCharacters:{x The code will list what players and mobs are currently in the
room.  Leave this blank.  

{WObjects:{x The code will list what objects are currently in the room.  Leave
this blank.  

{WDescription:{x How does your room look?  This is what players will see when
they first enter the room.  

Now, once you have built your first room, you will want to build more.  But
how?  Instead of using the "redit create" command for every room you wish to
create, you can link rooms to an existing room and the code will
automatically create them.  Here's how: 

Once you have built room 123, you can build 4 rooms off of it.  One to the
north, south, east or west.  The command is "east dig 124" or "north dig
124" etc.  By typing "done" and looking at your room, you should now see an
exit in the direction you created your link.  By moving in that direction,
you are now able to "edit room" and begin building that room in the editor. 

After you have linked your rooms together using the link command, when you
hit enter, you will see something like this "-West to [12544] Key: [ 0] Exit
flags: [door]" listed after the "WObjects{x section.  This is information
about the west exit in that room.  

{W-Direction to [vnum]{x: Tells you which directions you can travel from the
room you are standing in and to which vnums they go to.  

{WKey:{x This is the vnum of the key that will open a locked door leading to the
specified direction.  You will need to create an key type object and then
use the syntax "key <vnum>" 

{WExit flags:{x It defaults to [door] but there are also commands that allow you
to modify this door.  It can be hidden or closed or locked, etc.  To see
available options, type "exit."  

When you are done with the room editor, type "done" and always remember to
"asave area" so that your work isn't lost in an accidental crash.  

As always, this help is meant to be a learning tool.  Please don't hesitate
to ask questions!  
 
And, most importantly, have fun!

0 BUTCHER~
The butcher skill can only be used if a mobile has been killed and is
useful in creating food so that you do not have to go to a shop to buy it. 

Once a mobile has been killed and there is a corpse in the room, type
"butcher corpse" and the skill will take effect, creating steaks that will
be left on the ground. Be sure to pick them up if you wish to eat them.

0 BURNING HANDS 'BURNING HANDS'~

A weave of {RFire{w which sends a blast of fire into the victim, burning them. 
This weave is much weaker than a fireball but does burn the person.

0 BANK BANKER BANKS~
Syntax: account
Syntax: deposit <amount> [gold | silver]
Syntax: withdraw <amount> [gold | silver]

Most major cities have what is known as moneylenders or bankers.  These
provide a service to safe store your coins and ease the burden to travel
with the weight.  

The 'account' command will have the moneylender check your current financial
status and tell you how many gold and silver coins you have.  

The 'deposit' command will have the moneylender take the amount of gold or
silver you wish to safe store in the bank.  

The 'withdraw' command will have the moneylender check your current
financial status and if you have the amount asked for, give you either the
gold or silver coins as requested.

0 EMBRACE SEIZE CHANNEL CAST UNCHANNEL RELEASE~
Skill Type: Active
Command: embrace/seize/channel <amount>
         cast <weave>
         unchannel/release

The embrace and seize skills allow channeler to use Saidar and Saidin
respectively.  The 'channel' command is an alternate form that works for
either male or female characters.  Using the commands with a number will
cause you to hold exactly that amount of the Source (so 'channel 100' would
cause your character to hold 100 of the power, split based on your sphere
maximums).  You can enter a number higher than your spheretotal, but you
risk gaining burnout points.  Using the commands without a number will hold
an amount of the Source based on your 'autochannel' setting in your score
sheet.  As your skill increases, you reduce the possibility that you will be
unable to grasp the Source when needed.  

Embrace, seize and channel only cause you to grasp the Source, not do
anything with it.  To use a weave, use the 'cast' command with the weave
name.  If you are not holding the Source when using the cast command, you
will automatically embrace/seize based on your autochannel setting, just as
if you had used the embrace/seize command without entering a number, and
this attempt can fail just like using the command.  If you succeed, you will
attempt to cast the named weave.  For weaves with multiple-word names, the
weave name can be put in single-quotes, such as "cast 'arrows of fire'".  

The 'unchannel' and 'release' commands allow you to let go of the Source
once you have grasped it.  It is recommended that you do this often, as
holding the Source for too long puts you at risk of gaining burnout points. 
~

0 ENDURANE HITPOINTS HP~
ENDURANCE is the measure of your character's stamina and remaining
energy.  This is used for movement, combat, and when using the One Power.  

HITPOINTS are the measure of your character's health.  The lower your
character's hitpoints, the closer they are to fainting or perhaps death. 
Both mobs and players attacking your character creates the possibilty of a
lowering of your hitpoints, as well as being poisoned by berries or another
source.  

Both endurance and hitpoints can be trained up to a certain level during
your adventuring career.  It is recommended that such training be done at an
early level to impart the maximum benefit of the gains made during leveling.

0 FADE MYRDDRAAL LURKS SHADOWMEN HALFMEN NEVERBORN FETCHES FADES~
When Trollocs mate and they fail to produce another Trolloc, there is a
possibilty of a throwback to the human side of their genetic makeup.  What
is produced is called a Myrddraal.  These creatures are on par in
intelligence with most humans, and looks somewhat similar, save a few
distinct differences.  They are tall, and sometimes described as handsome,
everyone nearly identical to the next, moving with a characteristic grace
often likened to the movements of a snake or serpant.  Their skin is pale,
pale white, their hair is dark black, and no facial hair is ever seen on
them.  Their blood is said to be black, and the most disturbing thing is
perhaps their lack of eyes, for where they should be there is only skin. 
Despite this, these creatures can indeed see, and rumor says they can even
see in dark; some say they live and travel in the shadows.  

Myrddraal, or Fades as they ae commonly called, control Trollocs as their
commanders in battle.  There is also talk that some Fades may link with
those Trollocs they lead, in effect being able to control them, however, at
the same time becoming the death of all of those linked Trollocs should the
Fade be killed.  

Unique to the Fades are their blades, forged in Thakan'dar.  These sword are
black, forged by shadowforgers.  Called shadow blades, they are dipped in
the black tainted streams of Shayol Ghul and 'seasoned' by a human soul.  A
mere scratch from the blade will bring death, and only the One Power can
heal or slow its affect.

94 shopkeeper~
In order to create a shopkeeper, the mob must be added as the first reset
in the room.  Example: "reset {R1{x mob <vnum> {G1{x {B1{x."  The red {R1{x symbolizes that
it is the first mob in the room.  The green {G1{x means that there is only one
of these shopkeepers/mobs in the area and the blue {B1{x means that there is
only one of these shopkeepers/mobs in the room.  

Once the mob is typed in as the first reset, ALL of the objects he/she will
be selling should follow.  For example, he is selling an apple.  So, the
second reset should look like this: "reset 2 obj <vnum of apple> none" The
none means that it will not be worn anywhere on the mob.  When you type
"reset" you should see an S in the second reset's line - meaning that it is
now a shop item the keeper will be selling.  Continue this process for the
third, fourth, fifth, etc items that the shopkeeper will be selling.  

If you list a random object in the reset and type "none" in the reset
location, it WILL appear in the shopkeeper's list of things to sell. 
However, if you type a wear location in the object's reset, it will appear
in the shopkeeper's equipment list.  If you break up the shopkeeper's
selling list with another mob, it will mess up your shop list.  So, be sure
to list ALL of the objects you wish the shopkeeper to sell before using any
other reset values.  

Once your shopkeeper is done and all of his selling items have been reset,
purge the room.  Then, type "edit room reset" and "list" You should see all
the items that are for sell.  If not, you have done the resets incorrectly
and should try again or seek help.  

After you have read all of this, you might ask "How do I create a
shopkeeper?"  The answer is that you edit your mob and type "shop assign". 
This will turn your ordinary mob into a shop keeper.  Then, you will need to
set the shop hours, profit and shop type.  Let's start with shop hours.  If
you want your shop to be open all the time, you would set the shop hours
from 1 to 23.  Or, "shop hours 1 23".  Otherwise, you can vary your hours: 1
to 6, 10 to 15, etc.  

Next comes profit.  In editing your shopkeeper, you will see "Markup for
purchaser."  The default is 100%.  If you want the shopkeeper to buy back an
object for more than its worth, you set the markup higher than 100. 
Otherwise, set it lower.  Next, you will see "Markdown for seller."  This
will determine how much the object can be bought from the shopkeeper for. 
The default is 100%.  If you purchase an item, you see that the shopkeeper
haggles with you.  If you want him to sell the object to the buyer for more
than it is worth, set the value higher than 100.  If he will sell it for
less than it is worth, set it lower than 100.  

Shop profit values are set by typing "shop profit 100 100".  The first 100
being the markup, the second 100 being the markdown.  

Finally, shop type.  These will need to be set to allow the shopkeeper to
buy back items.  Traditionally, he should only buy back the same type of
items he sells.  For example, if he is only selling a canteen, he should
only buy back drink containers.  So, you would set his shop type as "shop
type 0 drinkcontainer".  For each additional object you are listing in the
shop types, use 1, 2, 3, etc.

0 FIREBALL 'ROLLING RING' WATERBALL~
Weave Type: Attacking
Spheres: Earth, {RFire{x / {yEarth{x, Fire / Air, {BWater{x
Command: cast fireball/'rolling ring'/waterball <target>
Initiates Combat: Yes
Used In Combat: Yes

These weaves do an increased amount of damage over the basic combat
weaves and can hit a target multiple times, though it is possible for the
additional hits to miss.  Training these weaves increases the number of
potential hits.  
~

0 SHIELDING~
Weave Type: Debuff
Spheres: {YSpirit{x
Command: cast shielding <target>

This weave creates a shield which prevents the target from accessing the
Power.  It is stronger when maintained, but in all cases can be broken by
someone with sufficient strength or untied if patient.  It is significantly
more difficult to use this weave on someone who is already holding the
Power.  This weave has no effect on non-channelers.  Training this weave
makes it more likely to work.  
~

0 BOND BONDING~
Weave Type: Active
Command:  cast bond <player>

The bond weave is a weave of Spirit that creates a link between two
people.  It is used by Aes Sedai of the White Tower to take people as their
Gaidin, with both characters gaining increased ability and some other neat
perks.  

Now that you know that, here are the rules:

- The bond weave is a granted weave which will be given to Aes Sedai of the
White Tower ONLY.  Unless you are involved in an IMM-driven RP where it is
granted to your character, do not bother asking for it.  

- Bonding is an IC act, but it must be agreed upon by both parties OOCly. 
Forcing someone into a Bond ICly is allowed if the RP works in that manner
and the character OOCly agrees to be Bonded.  If a Bond is forced onto
someone OOCly, the Bond will be undone and the aggressor will be {RDELETED{x.  

- The bond weave is not to be taught to anyone who is not Aes Sedai, ICly or
OOCly.  If it is, both the teacher and the student will be {RDELETED{x.  

- Currently, you are not allowed to bond people who are members of the
Children of the Light.  Bonding a wolfkin, male channeler or member of the
same gender is allowed, but you will be expected to deal with the
ramifications and RP it accordingly.  This will be checked up on to
determine if it is being ignored.  

- Currently, unbonding or passing of bonds is not allowed.  Bonding is not
something to take lightly ICly or OOCly; once Bonded, both parties are tied
to each other until one of them dies.  An exception will be made to this
rule IF one of the Bonded pair does not log on their character for a period
of three REAL LIFE months for more than five hours.  If this occurs, the
Bonded PC who is left may petition to have the bond released, which will
result in the IC death of the character who has not logged on.  THIS MEANS
that if you agree to be Bonded, YOU AGREE that your character can and will
be deleted and to have your Bonded partner write a story about your death if
you do not log in for three months.  

- Currently, members of the Green Ajah are allowed no more than two Bonded,
and members of any other Ajah are allowed only one.  Members of the Red Ajah
are allowed to Bond, but their choice must be approved by the IMM staff.  

Bonding is not something to be taken lightly.  Consider your RP and what you
know about the person you are RPing with, and choose wisely.  
~

0 GAIDIN WARDER~
Aes Sedai have a weave which is learned upon becoming Aes Sedai which is
quite unique.  This weave, a composition of mainly Spirit, binds the Aes
Sedai to a man of her choice permanently.  In doing this, the man is given
the ability to heal quickly, to go without rest, food, or water for long
periods of time and the unique ability to sense the taint of the Dark One,
even froma distance.  As well, both Aes Sedai and her Warder, as they are
called, are given the ability to sense one another's state of health.  If
either dies, the other will sense it.  However, there is a difference, for
if the Aes Sedai should be the one to die, the Warder will lose his will to
live and seek death often times.  Very rarely are they able to be kept
alive.  

Warders are also know as Gaidin, a term which means Brother to Battles. 
They go into the bonding almost always voluntarily, though some have been
done against the Warder's will.  The loyalites of the Gaidin are completely
to their Aes Sedai, and they live where their Aes Sedai lives.  For example,
when on the grounds, the Gaidin remain in a special area, their own private
quarters closely set to the Tower.  

Gaidin's numbers are not dictated by Tower Law, however by tradition, a man
is not bonded to Red Aes Sedai ever.  Most other Ajahs, should they have a
Gaidin, remain with only one.  There is an exception, in that the members of
the Green Ajah tend to bond as many as they wish.  

While the closeness of the bond may seem to lend to a certain ammount of
intimacy, the relations are chaste a majority of the time.  Aes Sedai have
many pressures and demands upon them, and Warders tend to fall into the role
of guardian and protector most often.  As with anything, there is
exceptions, and Aes Sedai on very rare occasions have been known to marry
their Warder, however this has usually only happened amoung members of the
Green Ajah.

0 Angenue~

0 VMAP~
The World map (or virtual map / vmap) is a graphical representation of
Randland as found in Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" books.  When you are on
the vmap, you see a character based representation of the land around you. 
To get a description of the symbols representing the World map, please see
the [ {Whelp legend{x ] section.
 
To enter the vmap, you need to find a room in the different sectors that has
a valid exit point. These are marked with a Leave(Area) in the exit prompt.
By typing '{Wleave{x' in a room that has this exit,  you will leave the area
and enter the World map.
 
Some locations on the vmap have links to areas. You will, in most cases,
find these marked with symbols like '{WC{x', but sometimes you will have to
examine the terrain more closely. Perhaps you will find a secret area or a
hidden treasure...
 
When you stand on a vmap location that is linked to an area, you will see
it marked as 'enter(nesw)' in the exit prompt. The characters inside the
() represent the direction which you can enter the area. By typing '{Wenter n{x',
for example, you will enter the area from the north end.

sword is a part of them, an extension of their will.  A Blademaster will
utilize various attack routines also called "forms".  Each form has it's own
properties and uses.  Some forms are used to create a spinning attack which
leaves an opponent off balance, while others comprise of vicious attacks
that penetrate an opponents defence.  Repeated usage of the Blademaster
skill will cause for these forms to be used more often in combat, as well as
a greater proficency with them.

The bounty system is now an ic system.  That means that both attackers need
to be flagged ic to get the money at the time you sub someone.  You only
have to SUB them, you do not have to FINISH them.  If you icly go after a
bounty, then you should have some ic reason to do so, and follow it up with
a story about the fight.  This way it will help foster more rp.  

BOUNTY <name> <amount> will extract gold from you and place it on a person's
head.  The next player to kill the person with the bounty gets to keep the
gold.  The bounty is cumulative so that if a certain guild wants someone
dead really badly, everyone in the guild can chip in on the bounty.

Skill Type: Active
Command: sharpen <weapon>

The sharpen skill allows weapons to be sharpened to make them more likely
to deal additional damage when used.  Use of this skill requires a
sharpening stone, and failing to sharpen a weapon properly will deal a small
amount of damage to you (indicating that you cut yourself while sharpening
the weapon).  Training this skill makes it more likely to work.

Some weapons are built to hold and edge and are already permanently
sharpened, and others have certain properties that prevent them from being
improved by sharpening.

0 GRANTS GRANTED GRANT~
Granted characters are characters given to mortals by the Immortals. 
Granted characters usually play a crucial role in the RP so it's important
for the player with a granted character to put in at least 10 hours every
week where he or she will be promoting RP.  

Asking for a granted character is the easiest way to NOT get one.  The
Immortals will decide among themselves if a player should or should not have
a granted character.  Abusing the powers of a granted character may have the
granted character taken from you as well as not logging on for the amount of
time determined by the Immortals (10 hours/week at least).  

Granted characters are a privilege and not a right.  The Immortals may
revoke such privilege as they see fit.  The granted character should be the
character receiving most attention from the player for that reason having an
alternate guildleader when you have a granted character is discouraged.

0 help.area Archery archer bow arrow~
To be an archer one must possess both the bow and arrow skills.  With
those skills, an archer may use the bow and arrows to shoot at their targets
from a distance, wounding them without being hit themselves.  In some cases,
if the archer is lucky, it will be a one shot one kill, but in most
instances the archer will have to shoot off several arrows to kill his or
her opponent.  The use of the bow and arrow are simple: 

You wield the bow as you would a sword or a dagger, and you hold the arrow. 


{x{WNOTE:{x You can NOT be using a shield or carrying any items in your 'held'
equipment space.  Archery requires both hands.  

Then: shoot <direction> <victim>

So if I wanted to shoot Zandor and he was in the room to my west I'd type:
shoot west zandor

It's that easy.  Archers are excellent for long range attacks and can do a
decent amount of damage, but they are not without their weaknesses.  You
cannot shoot someone or anything if they or it is in the same room with you,
though if you're wielding the bow, you can beat them with it.  Also, if you
fire 20 arrows, then when you'll have to retrieve 20 arrows, as they are
arrows and not boomerangs and will not come back to you automatically.  Some
people use macros and/or aliases to shoot and collect their arrows and that
seems to help.  
~

0 ANDORAN ANDOR~
The largest nation of the land, Andor is also one of the oldest.  It is a
large and wealthy nation reaching from the Mountains of Mist to the River
Erinin, though the decrease of population has prevented her Queens from
exercising their control of lands west of the River Manetherendrelle for
several generations.  Exports such as wool, precious metals and iron work,
tabac and grain give Andor a healthy economy.  The Andoran mark is more
highly valued and has more weight in gold than "equivalent" coins of other
nations.  

The sigil of Andor is a rampant white lion, also referred to as the White
Lion and her banner is that of a white lion rampant on a field of red.  Her
symbols include the Lion Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor.  Caemlyn in the
capital city.  

Andor is a country of many old traditions, the most widely known is that
only a queen may sit upon the Lion Throne and wear the Rose Crown, never a
king.  The eldest daughter is named Daughter-Heir.  By law, she is first
sent to the White Tower to study, then ascends the throne upon her mother's
death or retirement.  Her eldest brother is named the First Prince of the
Sword and is sworn to protect and defend his sister with his life.  The
First Prince is trained from childhood to command the Queen's armies in
times of war and to be her military advisor.  If the Queen has no surviving
brother, she appoints the First Prince.  

The people of Andor are usually fair-skinned, often with blue eyes and blond
hair, though dark eyes and hair are common.  Andoran women usually wear
dresses with square-cut necks showing little if any cleavage, and fitted
sleeves.  These dresses are occasionally embroidered with flowers and
leaves, and are worn belted at the waist.  Highborn ladies' dresses are
usually made of silk, with the embroidery and belt in metallic threads. 
Commoners wear the same basic style of dress, but of wool, usually with
higher necklines and with an apron.  

Andoran men wear trousers and shirts with a coat cover all.  The coat is
made with turned-back cuffs and an upstanding collar.  Among the nobility
the material is often silk or brocade, and the coat is often embroidered in
metallic threads.  Common men wear strong, serviceable wool.  

Men and woman both both wear cloaks as needed.  

Palace servants wear a livery of red with white collars and cuffs and the
White Lion of Andor upon their chests.  

The uniforms of the Queen's Guard include a red undercoat, gleaming mail and
plate armor, and a brilliant red cloak.  Long white collars hang over the
armor, and the white cuffs gleam at the wrist.  Their helmets are conical
with barred visors, and they often carry lances with thin red streamers
fluttering from their tips.  High ranking officers wear knots of rank on
their shoulder.  The Captain General wears four golden knots and wide gold
bands on his white cuffs.

0 seafolk atha'anmeire~
"{x{CA ship is alive...  Treat him well and care for him properly and he will
fight for you against the worst sea.  {x" --Sea Folk saying

Most of the islands in the Aryth Ocean and the Sea of Storms are home port
to the Atha'an Miere, most commonly known as Sea Folk.  Only a few of these
island groups are known to outsiders, and fewer still have been seen by
them, since the Atha'an Miere do not usually allow visitors or traders,
though they are certainly not as cruel to intruders as the people of Shara
or Seanchan.  The Sea Folk perform most sea trade, and nearly all of the
trade in silk and ivory from Shara, yet few people know them save through
stories and legend.  

To understand the Atha'an Miere, you must look at their ships and the waters
they sail because People of the Sea live out most of their lives aboard
their ships.  They are born on the water- even if their mother must row out
from shore in a borrowed boat to bear her child- and they die on the water
if at all possible.  Any time spent away from the sea is time spent awaiting
another ship, another voyage.  To the Atha'an Miere, each ship is a living
spirit, gifted with a man's heart and a man's courage.  These ships are just
as much a part of the Sea Folk family as any human.  The new crew themselves
oversee the construction of their ship, doing most of the skilled labor
themselves.  The ship is usually owned by the clan of the Sailmistress who
captains him, if not by the Sailmistress herself, though occasionally a ship
belongs to a clan different from those who sail him.  The ships fall into
four general classes.  From smallest to largest, they are the darter,
soarer, skimmer, and raker.  Anything smaller than a darter is considered a
boat, not a ship.  The fastest class of ship is the raker.  These ships are
far superior than any other ocean vessels in speed and manageability and are
the key to the Atha'an Miere's unquestioned dominance of the sea trade.  

The Sailmistress is the commander of the ship and crew.  She controls where
and when the ship travels as well as who may board him.  She is aided by the
Windfinder, who is second officer and chief navigator.  Some Windfinders can
channel, and that is kept secret by the Atha'an Miere.  Defense and trade is
managed by the Cargomaster.  He is usually married to the Sailmistress and
has final word in all the trade negotiations and matters of defense.  He
cannot tell the Sailmistress where to sail and she cannot tell him what
goods to trade for.  

The Atha'an Miere are exotic in appearance, wearing brightly colored tattoos
on their hands, sometimes denoting clan, and equally brilliant sashes on
their waists, gold and silver jewelry and a distinct style of dress.  

Throughout the known world, tales relate the almost irresistable allure of
the Sea Folk women, the epitome of beauty and temptation.  The deep
chocolate coloration of their skin and their unequaled grace, born of years
balancing on wind-lashed rigging on the high seas, contribute to their
allure; the Sea Folk custom of wearing nothing above the waist except
jewelry once beyond sight of land has enhanced the legends.  The well
muscled men, clean-shaven are bare-chested, are also considered dangerously
handsome.  

Men and women both wear baggy breeches held at the waist by brightly colored
sashes, multiple earrings, neck chains and bracelets, and bare feet, though
the quality of the breeches and scarf fabrics is directly related to status
and financial state of the wearer.  The women also wear brightly colored,
loose fitting blouses, though only while in port- probably in attempt to
avoid shocking the locals.  The women also wear a ring in the left side of
their nose.  Women of rank wear a fine chain, hung with medallions,
connecting the nose ring with one of their earrings.  The quantity of
medallions is directly related to rank.  The more medallions, the higher the
rank.  The men do not wear nose chains or nose rings.

0 Shienar Shienaran~
"{x{BPeace favor your sword.  {x" --Shienaran warrior's blessing

Shienar lies in the far northeast, flanked by the Mountains of Dhoom and the
Spine of the Dragon, it is a last bastion of civilization on the razor's
edge of the bleak corruption of the Blight and dangers of the Aiel Waste. 
Winters there are cold enough that trees burst as their sap freezes, yet
only a short distance away the Blight swelters in unnatural heat oppressive
enough to drain a strong man's will.  

The struggle to survive on the Blightborder affects every aspect of a
Shienaran warrior's life and thoughts.  Ask any what three things he values
most, he will almost certainly answer the following: Peace- because he has
known only war.  Beauty- because the Blight is filled with ugliness.  And
most of all, life- because he has already sworn himself to death.  For these
men, death is certain.  Therefore it is the quality of life that matters,
the honor gained, not the quantity of material wealth.  Each lives his life
prepared for battle, protected by heavy clothing and armor, but in death
each is lowered unclothed into the welcoming dirt of the grave, with neither
coffin nor shroud to protect his body.  They believe all came from earth,
and they must return as they came, naked and unarmed, into the last embrace
of the mother.  

All mounted Shienaran warriors are known as lancers because of the fighting
lances they carry.  They are certainly the finest heavy cavalry in the land.
They are also easily recognized, as each man wears his hair in a topknot,
with his head partially shaved around it.  His weapons are always close at
hand, with most fighters wearing a broadsword, axe or mace at their belt. 
Even in the safety of the fortresses, weapons are hung in readiness on every
wall, or so on stands near every bed.  Armor is usually a combination of
leather, mail, and plate, often covered by a surcoat with a black hawk on
it.  Their powerful warhorses are armored as well, with steel barding
protecting the vulnerable head, neck and chest.  The loss of a horse can
mean death for even a skilled warrior during combat with a Trolloc.  

Every major Shienaran town is designed to be a defensible fortress. 
Wherever possible the town is centered on high ground to command the
surrounding countryside.  The perimeter for a half-mile or more around each
town is clear-cut to prevent sneak attacks, nothing taller than clipped
grass is allowed to remain.  This lack of cover, as well as tall lookout
towers built into the perimeter walls, makes it impossible for anything to
approach unseen.  The formidable town gates are reinforced with iron to
insure that any hostile forces that dare to cross the clearing will find no
easy entrance.  

Some cities, like Fal Dara, have a law that no one may wear a hood while
within the city walls.  This is because of the threat of Myrddraal, the
hooded and eyeless shadowspawn that hides and transports themselves by
shadows.  People wearing hoods can easily be mistaken for a Myrddraal and
may be killed.  

Shienar is usually ruled by a King who resides in the capital city of FAl
Moran.  The country sigil is a swooping black hawk, the Black Hawk and her
banner is the Black Hawk on a field of three blue and two white horizontal
stripes.

The link skill allows channelers to link with other channelers in order
to increase their power.  Linking can only be done between members of a
group, and the balance of men to women in the link is enforced (in that
there must be more women than men in a link if there is more than one man).

0 GUARD~
Skill Type: Active
Command: guard <target>/self

The guard skill is used to protect other people with you by placing yourself
in harm's way on their behalf.  This can only be used on other players who
are a member of your group, and if either you or your target leave the
group, the guarding will automatically end.  

Typing 'guard <target>' will cause you to guard your target; if they are in
combat and being attacked, a number of the attacks directed at them will
instead be directed at you, and you will defend against it just as if the
attacker was fighting you.  Training the guard skill increases the
likelihood of guarding attacks.  Note that you can only guard one target at
a time; typing 'guard <target>' for another member of your group will stop
guarding your original target and start guarding the new target.  

To stop guarding someone, enter 'guard self' or leave the group.

0 PK 'PK RULES' 'TROLLOC RULES'~
The following rules apply to PK here on {RAge Of Illusion{x:

{RIn Character playerkill{x means a fight where both people are IC and in RP,
and can result in the loser's death ICly.  This must be RPed out and a story
must be written afterward explaining why and how the person was killed. 
These situations will be reviewed by the IMM staff and IC PK that involves
someone with no good reason to be there ICly or who does not follow the
rules will be dealt with very harshly.  

{BOut Of Character playerkill{x can NEVER result in someone being dead ICly; it
can only be a simple code fight that has no ramifications on the character
other than them being subdued for a short time.  That said, the following
rules apply to OOC PK: 

- Killing players who are AFK is not allowed UNLESS you can see that they
are active (moving through rooms, talking on public channels, etc.)  . 
Putting up your AFK flag to try to avoid an imminent PK will not be looked
upon with kindness.  

- Killing players who are idle is not allowed.  However, if you use a
trigger to periodically send a command to prevent you from voiding out, do
not expect the PKer to know that you are idle.  

- Killing players that are in RP is not allowed unless you are participating
in the RP as well.  Refer to the section about about IC PK.  

- Killing players in their recall is not allowed, nor are you allowed to
wait outside someone's recall to kill them when they leave.  

- Killing newbies or players within newbie areas (such as the newbie school)
is not allowed.  This will be dealt with EXTREMELY harshly.  

- Killing players on the VMAP is not allowed.  

- If you participate in PK (actively tracking down and attacking other
players) and do not have the PK flag, you may be given the flag at the IMM
staff's discretion.  

- Once you have PKed someone, leave them alone.  Repeatedly subduing someone
without giving them a chance to run is not allowed and will be dealt with
EXTREMELY harshly.  In addition, if you have OOCly PKed someone and they ask
you to leave them alone, do so for at least two days when they are first
PKed and for at least one week after any subsequent PK.  PKing someone after
they have asked you to stop without waiting will be considered harassment
and will be dealt with EXTREMELY harshly.  

- All PK in the arena is considered OOC.

{MTrollocs{x have the following additional rules applied to them in regards to
PK:

- Trollocs can only be IC within the Blight and the Borderlands unless they
are part of an RP with a Fade or Forsaken.  Any PK done by a Trolloc outside
these areas without a Fade or Forsaken is considered OOC.  

- If a Trolloc is in RP with a Fade or Forsaken, their word is LAW. 
Trollocs are required to follow orders given to them and can be killed on
the spot by their superiors as punishment for disobedience.  

- Trolloc players are allowed to ICly RP as a faceless Trolloc

- Repeated killing of the same person OOC for the purposes of gaining points
in trollocwarfare is not allowed, even if the other player is willing.

0 'INVERT WEAVE' INVERT~
Skill Type: Active
Command: invert <weave>/all <target>/room

The invert skill is a rare ability that allows channelers to hide weaves
they have previously tied, making it more difficult or even impossible for
others to untie them or even know they are there.  Training this skill makes
it easier to invert your weaves.  Inverting a weave that has already been
inverted will make it visible to everyone again.  

Though inverting a weave makes it hidden, its effects can still be felt; for
example, inverting the wrap weave will make the weave unable to be seen, but
the target will still be unable to move.  
~

0 COMMANDS~
Syntax: commands
Syntax: commands rp
 
The 'commands' command show you all the commands that are available in the game.
 
The 'commands rp' option show you all the commands that are logged when a player

0 WAFFECTS WARDS SENSING_WARDS~
Syntax: waffects <direction>
 
The waffects command allows a channeler to try sense for wards set on
a room or an area. Sensing wards that is beyond you is difficult. Sensing wards
that is made with little usage of the One Power, or inverted, will be almost impossible
to detect, even for a skilled eye.
~

0 TYING TIE UNTIE~
Skill Type: Active
Command: tie <weave>/all <target>/room/ward
         untie <weave>/all <target>/room/ward

The tying skill allows a channeler to 'tie off' a weave that they are
sustaining on a person or the room.  Tying the weave means that it will
eventually fade away, but it also means that the channeler no longer has to
concentrate on it and can go elsewhere without the weave collapsing, such as
creating a wall of air and then moving on to keep it there to ward off foes.

The tying skill also allows channelers to attempt to untie weaves that have
been tied previously, either by themselves or someone else.  The difficulty
of this task depends on the tying skill of the person who tied it; training
the tying skill makes it much more difficult for others to untie your
weaves.  

Tying weaves on yourself or a target refers to weaves such as wrap that
apply to a person.  Tying weaves on the room refers to weaves such as wall
of air that apply to the room.  Tying wards refer to weaves such as
Shadowspawn ward or eavesdrop ward.

0 acceptdeath~
Syntax: acceptdeath <new name> [keep]

Acceptdeath is used after someone has killed your character.  

Before you use it, post any remaining notes that you need to post from the
waiting room.  Say your ooc farewells, keep it clean....  

And then use the command.  

In order to keep your current stats and spheres (for those of you that have
put tons of time and quest tokens into them) type "acceptdeath <newname>
keep".  If you do not type the "keep" on the end, you will be rerolled with
new stats and spheres.  

This command will allow you to pick a new name and go through creation
again.  You will be reset to level 1.  You will, however, be granted enough
experience to level back up to 3/4 of your previous level.  

Ignore the mistakes in the totals when setting merits, flaws, and talents
for the moment.  They will be corrected shortly.

0 finish~
Syntax: finish <person>

Use "finish" when you have subdued someone icly and wish to finish them off
(read kill them/put them out of their misery/put them out of your
misery/etc) 

Both you and the victim MUST be in Complete IC mode (toggled by the RP
command) Your victim MUST have been subdued completely.  Knocking them over
the head just won't cut it, you have to take them down.  

WARNING  WARNING  WARNING  WARNING  WARNING

To be perfectly clear on this.  Abusing this in any form will get you
deleted.  

Abuses include killing people in places you would have no IC way of getting
to.  If you think you can get there, even though it's difficult, clear it
with the Admin first.  

It also includes going into RP mode to attempt to make a kill, fleeing when
you realize you're going to get plastered, and dropping out of RP mode to
escape the consequences.  

For the victim, it includes dropping out of RP mode in the middle of a fight
(or in the middle of fleeing) to make sure you aren't killed.  Once an IC
fight has been started, it is expected to be completed IC.  
~

0 LOOT LOOTING~
Syntax: loot <object> <victim>

Looting objects from people is to be done ONLY In Character.  

When you mug someone, and you really want something of theirs, and you have
put them past the point of caring at the moment whether you take it or not
(read subdued them), you may take what you desire with the loot command.  

The exceptions to looting being done IN Character is if you are attacked and
you subdue your opponent, or if you are retaliating for a prior incident. 
If you antagonize someone, there is now something that can be done.

0 FORSAKEN AGINOR~
Aginor

He had helped make the Trollocs, blending human and animal stock--he was
proud of that, of the skill involved, the difficulty--but these occasional
throwback offspring made him uneasy at the best of times.  

Almost as strong as Lews Therin, he was the greatest biologist,
understanding molecules and atoms better than any other.  He always wanted
to do genetic experiments, but wasn't allowed to by the Hall of Servants,
being disciplined many times for experiments on animals.  He pledged to the
Dark One in the first thirty years of the Collapse.

understanding molecules and atoms better than any other.  He always wanted
to do genetic experiments, but wasn't allowed to by the Hall of Servants,
being disciplined many times for experiments on animals.  He pledged to the
Dark One in the first thirty years of the Collapse.  

He was sealed just beneath the surface and was subjected to nightmares. 
Along with Balthamel, he was the first to be freed from the Dark One's
prison.  He appeared at the Eye of the World older than old.  His skin like
thin parchment drawn tight over his skull.  Wispy tuffs of hair at odd
places on a scabby scalp.  His ears were withered bits of ancient leather
and had sunken eyes and yellowed teeth.  No finger nails and knuckles
gnarled and barely human.

0 FORSAKEN ASMODEAN~
Asmodean

He pulled open a small door, intending to find his way to the pantry.  There
should be some decent wine.  One step, and he stopped, the blood draining
from his face.  You?  No!"  The word still hung in the air when death took
him" Taller than most in his middle years.  Atractive with dark deep set
eyes and dark hair.  He holds his head tilted when apprehensive.  

Born in the port town of Shorelle, he was a child prodigy in composition and
performance of musical instruments.  However, he never fulfulled the promise
he showed - although he did gain a third name.  

He pledged himself to the Dark One so that he would have forever to become
the composer and performer that his prodigousness showed.  He served as
governor in many regions and had his former rivals made unable to produce
their art via blinding, chopping etc.  He had his mother severed and dragged
off by Myrddaal.  

~

0 FORSAKEN BALTHAMEL~
Balthamel

In the Age of Legends, he was an historian, specialising in vanished
cultures.  He studied at the institute for higher learning at M'Jinn. 
However, he was reckless, with a short, wildfire temper that couldn't be
controlled.  He was almost bound against doing violence.  It may be due to
this that he never earned the third name.  Also, he spent much time in the
lowest taverns, fraternising with crimials and footpads.  

Good looking, he was also a womaniser.  He wanted to look good forever, and
so pledged himself the the Dark One around the middle of the Collapse.  He
set up camps to breed humans for trolloc food.  He may have run an
intelligence network.  He may have held a govenorship.  When the bore was
sealed he was trapped closer to the surface than Aginor.  His face was
rotten and his tongue had rotted completely.  Along with Aginor, was the
first to be freed from the Dark One's prison.  Being close to the surface of
the prison for three thousand had whithered his face and tongue away.  When
confronting the group at the Eye of the World he wore a tight leather black
carapace covering his head and face completely, with the front worked into a
young laughing man's face.  As Aginor killed Someshta, he killed Balthamel. 


As Aran'gar, she has the body of a gorgeous woman stolen from the
borderlands, slender and lush.  She has green eyes, an ivory oval shaped
face and long glossy black hair.  She became Delana's Secretary, and then
become Egwene's maid.  She is giving headaches through a nightly massage as
well as torturing her with nightmares.

0 FORSAKEN BE'LAL~
Be'lal

Do you remember when we took that tame sport called swords and learned to
kill with it, as the old volumes said men once had?  

Tall and athletic, with close cropped white hair.  He is a patient tactition
and cunning planner, a master of manipulation, he has been called the
Netweaver..  He was also a capable fighter being direct when neccessary. 
These skills helped him become a brilliant swordsman in a bloodless sport in
the Age of Legends.  

Originally a good friend of Lews Therin.  He was one of the leaders in the
fight against the shadow and an outstanding general.  But he envied Lews
Therin so much that he turned to the Dark One during the Collapse.  He also
envied Mieran and Elan Morin.  He once beat Lews in a game of stones, and
bragged about it forever.  He was one of the best swordsmen of his time, a
true blademaster.  He was among those who razed the Hall of the Servants
days before the bore was sealed.  
~

0 FORSAKEN DEMANDRED~
Demandred

Demandred captured two cities just because he though the people there had
slighted him before he went over to the Shadow, and every man, woman and
child went into Trolloc Bellies.  

Almost handsome and reaonably tall with a hawk nose.  Almost as strong as
Lews in the One Power and almost as honored and influencial.  He was the
second most acclaimed man of the Age of Legends behind Lews Therin Telamon. 
He held high offices, and wrote books, not quite as high or succesful as
Lews Therin.  Because of all this, he hates Lews Therin with every ounce of
himself - more than Sammael - thinking him a lucky fool.  

Demandred was one of the great generals for the Light.  A gambler, he played
the odds with strategic vision and tactical flare.  When Lews became
Commander of the Light, Demandred's hatred grew.  He turned to the shadow in
the third year of the War of Power.  

Adapting well, he became one the Dark One's best Generals.  He punished
everyone who had dishonored him or slighted him.  Even to the point of
killing the entire population of a city.  

~

0 FORSAKEN ISHAMAEL~
Ishamael

Yes, Betrayer of Hope.  They gave me the name to revile me, but I will yet
make them kneel and worship it.  A little shorter than Lews Therin, he was
in the prime of maturity: good looking with fine cut dark clothes.  His
mouth and eyes sometimes open to endless caverns of flame.  He has white
teeth, dark eyes, cruel lips and a mellifluous voice.  

Orginally a Philosopher he was often too esoteric for popular appeal.  He
wrote many books including, "Analysis of Perceived Meaning", "Reality and
the Absence of Meaning" and "Disassembly of Reason".  He believed that the
war between the soul of Lews Therin and the Dark One had occured since the
beginning of time.  He was the Dark One's greatest champion being almost
equal in the One Power as Lews Therin.  

He was probably the first to pledge himself the the Dark One and acted as
peace maker between the forsaken.  Although he never held a field command,
he was defeated by Lews Therin at the gates of Paaran Disen.  He announced
his betrayal at a conference of Aes Sedai, informing them of what it was
they faced.  His announcement sparked massive riots.  He was given the name
Ishamael by the people: Betrayor of Hope.  When the Dark One's Prison was
sealed he was only half sealed behind it, allowing him to touch the world in
human form.  He schemed from the time of the breaking until he died in the
stone of Tear.  He told Lews Therin to kill his family.  He then gave him
the moment of sanity so that he understood what he had done.  He started
calling himself Ba'alzamon during the breaking of the world and was revered
by trollocs, and feared by Myrddraal.  He ravaged the world when he sent
trollocs forth, causing the trolloc wars.  In FY 973, Ishamael came to Artur
Hawkwing's court as Jalwin Moerad.  He became Hawkwing's highest counsellor
by summer 974, and held that position until Artur's death in FY 994.  He set
abou wrecking that which Hawkwing had built.  He had Artur do the following:
Dismiss all Aes Sedai from his service.  Lay seige to Tar Valon.  Send his
armies across the Ocean.  Refuse Aes Sedai Healing on his death bed.  As
well as others we may not know about.  Jalwin Moerad had a volatile temper,
and was half mad.  He had frequent long absences and anyone who enquired
about him closely died.  Takima didn't like him and he was openly
contmptuous of Aes Sedai.  Days after Artur's death he became the councillor
to and then had killed the three closest contenders for the throne, one by
one.  They were Marithelle Camaelaine, Norodim Nosokawa and then Elfraed
Guitama.  Jalwin appeared for 40 years, and then disappeared, never aging a
day.  This lends support to Aran's theoies.  Shamael can, therefore, be
credited with the greatest catastrophes of the third age: The trolloc wars,
and the War of Hundred years.  Truly the Dark One's top Captain.

0 FORSAKEN RAHVIN~
Rahvin

Tall dark and as handsome as Lanfear is beautiful with a very deep chest,
stong hands and wings of white at his temples and dark eyes.  

Incredibly proud, he loves power, and is envious of anyone who has some. 
Much prefering diplomacy over outright attack using subtle compulsion and
manipulation, but he can be very hard.  He always chooses his risks with
prudence.  He is very strong in the One Power, being stonger than Lanfear,
and almost as strong as Rand.  

He turned to the Shadow because of his thirst for power.  Through his
manipulations he had several regions surrender without invasion.  He was an
efficient Governor, but with a lack of attention to detail.  He loves being
flattered and women.  He rarely had a woman without using compulsion.  Upon
his release from the bore, he moved to Caemlyn.  When the riots in Caemlyn
started (probably by him), he became the leader of the faction supporting
Morgase.  He put the riots down, and Morgase promoted him to Elaida's old
post.  
~

0 FORSAKEN SAMMAEL~
He has blue eyes and blond hair with a neat square trimmed beard. 
Compact, solid and seemingly large he is above average in looks except fo a
large poker like scar down his face from hair to jaw.  He has a quick stride
and an abrupt manner.  He likes to dupe his enemies into thinking they can
catch him by surprise.  

During the Age of Legends, he was a world renowned sportsman, with archery
and swords.  He was a good friend of Lews Therin, and when the war started,
he was found to be one of the best generals - especially when defending.  

He loved honors and privileges, but he wanted the command of the forces for
the Light.  Because Lews Therin became Commander, Sammael hated him.  He
turned to the Shadow in the forth year of the War of Power so that he could
personally destroy Lews.  Graendal herself took Sammael to Shayol Ghul.  

The provences he governed were ignored while he committed people and
resources to grandiose schemes.  However, like his sports equipment, he
always cared for his soldiers.  

~

0 FORSAKEN GRAENDAL~
Graendal

Have you murdered children?  Graendal did.  She called it kindness so they
would not suffer after she enslaved their parents and carried them away.  

Stunningly beautiful, (although Nynaeve thinks her merely plumply pretty)
she is buxom and vouptuous.  She has long red-blond hair and wears lots of
jewelery, indulging herself to the extreme.  The only people she won't flirt
with are Chosen who are above her.  

Kamarile Maradim Nindar was a famous dedicated ascetic in the Age of
Legends.  She was brilliant at treating people with disturbed minds - the
best at brain manipulations - being honoured for her work.  However she was
hard and cutting towards those who didn't live up to her standards.  She was
approximately 400 years old when the bore was opened.  Ten years after the
bore was drilled she became the complete opposite of what she had been, with
a total fixation on sexuality and sensuality.  With 25 years of the Collapse
beginning, she was the second person to commit to the Shadow.  The day she
announced her alleigance, the War of Power began.  During the war, she
helped riots occur, suicides and others behave to help the Dark One without
their knowledge.  She uses compulsion to gain servants who are beautiful and
were powerful, killing all of their children.  Although the level of
compulsion she uses leaves them for little more than decoration.  She
doesn't think of much beyond sensual pleasure.  On the surface anyway. 
Delving a bit deeper would discover a desire to pull down anyone with power
- which explains her need for powerful servants - and deepest of all is the
thirst for her own power.  Soon after her transition she made the journey to
Shayol Ghul and pleged her soul to the Shadow.  She accompanied Sammael to
Shayol Ghul when he turned to the shadow also.  

She is very good at hiding, being the best ever at compulsion.  After being
freed from the bore she took a palace in Arad Doman, throwing out a family
and their servants to do so.  She pretends to be a dying old woman - the
Lady Basene - who seems to support all sides.

0 FORSAKEN LANFEAR~
Lanfear

Lews Therin was mine, he is mine, and he will be mine, forever.  

Creamy, pale, smooth and soft skin.  Very dark eyes and raven dark hair. 
Tall - only a hand shorter than Rand - with a thin waist, she moves with
amazing grace.  She has flowing black hair and always wears pure white.  

The most powerful of the female forsaken, not quite as powerful as Rand . 
She was doing honest research in the Collam Daan with Beidomon, the team
discovered and drilled into the Dark One's Prison, causing the Collapse and
later the war of Power.  Many people died in the backlash of the drilling. 


She always believed she was a power unto herself, with only a passing glance
at what the Dark One wanted.  She and Lews Therin Telamon were lovers, but
he broke it off years before the bore was drilled when he realise she was
only interested in power and ambition.  Lanfear has continued to love Lews,
or at least, she loved her association with him - the path to power - and
believed he would still love her if not for Ilyena.  She has transfered her
love to Rand.  She pledged herself to the Shadow soon after she gate crashed
Lews and Ilyena's wedding and chose her own name: The Daughter of the Night.
She proclaimed the Dark One in the Hall of Servants.  Lanfear considers
Tel'aran'roid to be her domain, claiming to own all dreams, even though
Moghedian could outstrip her in the Unseen World.  She helped many people
commit suicide and sent people mad through dream stalking.  When she woke
from being sealed in the prison, she immediately sought out Rand, taking on
the form of Selene: a young and beautiful woman.  Although she pushed Rand
towards power, he did not bite.

children and young people were taught theglories of the Dark On, taught to
kill their firends who didn't learn well enough or fast enough.  

F average height and appearance.  She is hard headed, practical, intelligent
and introspective.  Just into her middle years, she was over 300 years old
when the bore was sealed.  She likes real power.  

Wanting to be a successful researcher, she applied to the Collam Daan.  She
was denied a place and instead she became a teacher.  So she pledged to the
Dark One.  

She was an orderly and efficient administrator, setting up educaton systems
in the conquered territories.  The children were taught to spy on each other
and parents.  Mobs tore down anything that detracted from the Dark One -
museums, libraries and research facilities.  Teachers, scientists and
parents were tried in courts entirely of children, and executed.  These
children, called Mesaana's Children, looted, burned and killed with wilful
disregard during the Breaking.

0 FORSAKEN MOGHEDIEN~
Moghedien

Why do you think your companions look so cheerful?  I have taught each of
them the same lesson already today.  I will not wonder when you must be
taught, too.  I will be done with you now.  Try.  

Sturdily handsome with large dark eyes and dark hair to her shoulders.  She
is stern like a big sister.  

Lillen Moiral lived over 200 years before the bore was opened but was
considered young for an Aes Sedai.  In the age of Legends, a moghedian was a
small spider that spun it's web in hidden places.  It's bite could kill in
seconds.  

She was an investment advisor, but was disciplined for violating ethics and
laws.  She turned to the Shadow in the early part of the Collapse, but kept
it secret until the middle of the War of Power.  

Lillen held a middle level rank in Lews Therin's command structure during
the War of Power, as well as running a secret intelligence network for the
Shadow.  When she was discovered, she sabotaged a public transport vehicle
to help her escape, only just getting away.  Thousands died.  She is
vengeful, never forgetting.  Hiding and taking no risks, she believes in
waiting until others fall before striking.  She always waits in the shadows
until weaknesses show before stiking, mostly because she is a coward.  As
strong as Nynaeve in the One Power, although Nynaeve may be getting
stronger.

0 FORSAKEN SEMIRHAGE~
Semirhage

Have you ever tortured an entire city, made thousands of people assist in
breaking each other slowly, in breaking their own loved ones?  Semirhage did
that, for no more reason than that she could, to prove she could, for the
pleasure for it.  

Taller than most men and well proportioned with long slender fingers.  She
is graceful and calm with dark eyes and a dark face.  She enjoys the simple
pleasure of needle work.  Because Lanfear wears white, Semirhage wears
black.  

Nemene Damendar Boann was the best Restorer ever, being called from anywhere
at an instant to Heal the impossible.  However once she had Healed her
patients, she like to extract some pain from them.  Most were too happy to
be alive to worry about a bit of torture, although if she thought they
didn't deserve to live, she would kill them.  When the Hall of Servants
found out, she was given the choice of being bound from sadism, or severing.
She chose Shayol Ghul instead and was one of the first to become Chose.  

She hates Aes Sedai totally, and exacted revenge on members of the Hall of
Servants, by breaking them and having them proclaim publicly for the Dark
One.  She Governed many times with cruelty and violence that stands out
among the chosen.  She discovered how to turn a channeller to the shadow
with a circle of thirteen channellers with thirteen Myrddraal.  

Semirhage takes enormous pleasure in cruelty and anguish.  She once tortured
an entire city with everyone breaking each other slowly until they all died.
Loved ones and friends breaking the spirit of each other, just to show she
could.  She also once made a man scream every waking moment for five years,
and kept him sane.  His heart finally failed.  A prisoner being told they
were being handed to Semirhage would commit suicide.  She considers death an
escape.

0 DUELLING~
For some skilled thiefs, wielding and using their daggers has become a
art much like the fine skilled warriors and their blademasters.  

A master of the daggers will utilize various attack and defensive routines
also called "forms".  Each form has it's own properties and uses.  

The duelling skill is a long lost art that only a very few posess.  Finding
these few is a task of seeking out the darker places and speak to the right
voices.  

There is rumors of a man, or a woman, that travels through the land teaching
a very few the skill of duelling.  A master thief indeed.  
~

0 OVERWHELM~

able to utilize this move.

a mounted victim can be devestating to a fight.

0 BIND ESCAPE AUTOBIND~
Skill Type: Active
Command: bind <target>
         free <target>
         escape

prevent them from leaving once they awaken.  Training this skill makes it
more difficult for people to escape or for others to free them.  You can
attempt to free someone who is bound by typing 'free <target>'.  

The escape skill is used to escape bindings on your own.  Training this
skill makes it easier to do.

balefire, don't emote it.  Do NOT use emweave to communicate with other
channellers in the room to get around a non-channeller hearing/seeing
something.

as it is.  If it is abused, it will be removed.

Jordan.  His website can be found at http://www.tor.com/jordan/

He has created a world in which many of the real worlds histories and lands
are used as a basis for a background of ideas, then twisted in ways to show
how they might fight together.  
 
The series can be purchased at just about any new book store, many used book stores, and easily found at http://www.amazon.com

0 CLIENT CLIENTS MUDCLIENT BOT BOTTING~
Many people use mud clients to make it easier to get around the game. 
They set triggers to pick things up, use paths to get from one place to
another, and use variables to store gate keys.  

The one requirement that we have is that you MUST be at the keys while using
your client.  Short trips afk to get a drink of water or take a bio-break
are acceptable.  Hours away while your character uses triggers to kill mob
after mob autonomously is not acceptable.  

Using triggers and timers to keep your character online is acceptable at the
moment, but we request that you use common courtesty when doing so.  Idling
in a heavily used levelling area in order to slow down repop is frowned
upon.  Of course, this brings up what does "frowned upon" mean.  It means
all sorts of things depending on how bad of a day that the Imm that has to
deal with it has had.  

Rest assured, if you get annoying, the immortals may get very creative.  
~

0 icloc iclocrecall ~
Syntax: iclocrecall <set>

This command sets a recall point for your IC Location.  It is to be used as
a way for you to get to the location you are roleplaying in quickly, and for
NO other purpose.  

Setting your iclocrecall location near the quest master is against the
rules.  Setting your iclocrecall any location that you are not currently
roleplaying in order to get past hard to get around mobs or hard to get
through mazes is abuse.  

Don't abuse it, or it will be removed from anything you, or any of your
characters can use.  
~

0 gdt ogdt sgdt ssgdt guildtalk~
Syntax: gdt <string> - GuildTalk <whatever> 
     Syntax: ogdt <string> - OtherGuildTalk <whatever> 
     Syntax: sgdt <string> - SubGuildTalk <whatever>
     Syntax: ssgdt <string> - SubSubGuildTalk <whatever>

These tools are the main means of IC and OOC Communication with the
currently online members of a guild or group.  Some muds have two channels
per guild, one for IC communication one for OOC communication.  We have a
single channel and hope that the players are capable of distinguishing the
difference.  

Some people prefer prefacing all IC communication with a flag which states
something similar to {G--{YIC{G--{x so there isn't any confusion that what they said
was to be taken as In Character.  Others prefer something like {Y--{GOOC{Y--{x for
all OOC communication, then do not flag their IC communications.  

In the player run guilds, the guild leader (meaning the single person in the
guildlevel 1 spot) can set the policy for the guild.  In the IMM run guilds
(where an IMM or no single person holds the glevel 1 spot) the rules are
that each person can use whatever method he or she prefers.  

If there is a set policy in a guild which you are participating in, the
guild leader should post that policy to the guild in the permanent note
section, and should use the leaderpost option so that a future guildleader
may change it as needed.  While that person is the guildleader, the
guildmembers should follow the posted guidelines.  

Once more to clarify; here on {RAge Of Illusion{x, the guild channels are
both IC and OOC, not specifically just one or the other.  Use it, don't
abuse it.  The guildleaders DO have the right to use gmute and ogmute when
there is a problem on the guildchannels but should use common sense in using
it.  
~

0 gmute ogmute~
Syntax: [o]gmute <guildmember>
