still want to be useful.

the old tongue for "Brother to Battle"- a very astute description of a
Warder.  He moves about with the agile grace of a cat, the purpose of a
shark in bloodfrenzy, every step thought out, and every turn balanced for
anything.  His color-shifting cloak gives him an outline that is queasy to
look at.  With his hand on his sword hilt, he scans the area for danger.

The Captain of the Towerguard is here checking up on his officers.

This man is tall, with thick forearms that show a life of dedication to
the sword, and years of experience in battle.  With just a touch of gray in
his dark brown hair, the Captain of the Towerguard has many years left in
command before he will seek retirement and a pension.  He walks with a
slight swagger, as most military men do, but the sword at his side moves
with him in a manner that must only come from a lifetime at his side.  He
talks to his men while keeping them and himself at ease, having earned his
respect, while also giving it.  His men are more than just soldiers or
guards, they are Towerguard, and live a life dedicated to the preservation
of the Tower and all that it stands for.  With such a dedication to duty
among his men, the Captain spends most of his days checking in on them, and
just generally giving praise where deserved.

enjoy a feeling of freedom found nowhere else in the realms.  Here in the

the Towerguard, it is unheard of for a woman to be able to walk the city
hindered, so many of the female citizens go about their daily tasks or just
enjoy the city's wonderful view undisturbed.

of the road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the
wharf can be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills

North Harbor Guard Tower~
This tower is sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked
white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest
light into brightness.  The arrowslits and lanterns set into the walls
provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an arrowslit
to the north overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of North Harbor.  The
view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the east leads back
outside.

Atop the West City Wall~
This is the walkway atop the beautiful long wall that protects the west
shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Jualdhe on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The North Harbor guard tower is to the north.  The wall continues
on to the south.

Jualdhe Gate Guard Tower~
This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns provide plenty of light either day or
night.  The wonderful view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the
section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to
the west is the village of Jualdhe, and the bridge that connects it with the
gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead deeper down into the guard

Above the Jualdhe Gate~
This is a section of the city wall that is above the Jualdhe Gate and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Jualdhe,
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

west shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the
same silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Darein on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The Darein Gate guard tower is to the south.  The wall continues
on to the north.

Darein Gate Guard Tower~
This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns provide plenty of light either day or
night.  The wonderful view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the
section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to
the west is the village of Darein, and the bridge that connects it with the
gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead deeper down into the guard
tower.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to the south lead back outside
atop the city wall.

Above the Darein Gate~
This is a section of the city wall that is above the Darein Gate and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of Tar Valon, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Darein
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are

the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns provide plenty of light either day or
night.  The view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone

Through the Darein Gate~
Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Darein spans to the west, across the section of the
River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  The bridge itself is a work
worthy of this beautiful city, being worked of stone with the intricacey of
patterned lacework.  To the east, the beautiful city of Tar Valon awaits,
with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and amazing towers of every
shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to the south lead into
the guard towers.

Intersection of Darein Avenue and West Teardrop Way~
This is the most beautiful city in the world, and no man or woman who has
ever been here in Tar Valon could deny it.  The most amazing towers rise
from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs, and every
tower is crafted from the whitest stone known to man or Ogier.  Several of
the towers have bridges that span the heights between them and other towers,
creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges catch the light
and glimmer brightly.  To the east rises the tallest and most beautiful of
all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the street is paved in
large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the many
visitors who travel this avenue.  Many small parks can be seen along the
avenue, as well as a few gardens.  The Darein Gate is to the west, leading
out of the city to the bridge that crosses the River Erinin.

South Tar Valon Boulevard~
Here the boulevard meets the entrance to the Southharbor wharf.  This
wide boulevard is used for merchants to transport goods from the Southharbor
directly to the Tower grounds, and to the other several shops and stores
near the center of the city.  Along the boulevard, several amazing towers
rise from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs. 
Several of the towers have bridges that span the heights between them and
other towers, creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges
catch the light and glimmer brightly.  To the north rises the tallest and
most beautiful of all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the
street is paved in large white marble flagstones that provide a level
footing for the many visitors who travel this boulevard.  A beautiful
redstone arch is here above the top of the stairs that lead down into the
wharf.  A road leads to the east and west and divides the city from the edge
of the wharf and harbor area.

East Southharbor Lane~
Here the city changes from an aesthetic design to a more practical one. 
The road is paved in flagstone, but not as large or even the same type of
stone used on the main boulevards and avenues of Tar Valon.  This road
offers a visible seperation from the harbor area and the city.  To the south
of the road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the
wharf can be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills
the skyline to the north.  The road continues to the east and to the west.

There is a shop to the north, with small statues of mighty sailors and
whimsical nymphs set in niches along the side of the building.  Unlike the
bustle of traffic that echoes from the wharf below, there seems to be no one
going in or out of the northern building.

building is to the north, with members of the city guard entering and
leaving it.  Though obviously not of the same Ogier-craftsmanship as the
architecture to the north, set in niches along this building are well
sculptured statues of valiant guardsmen wearing the favour of Tar Valon.

This tower is sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked
white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest
light into brightness.  The arrow slits and lanterns provide plenty of light
either day or night.  The view through an arrow slit to the south overlooks
the roofs down in the wharf of South Harbor.  The view through an arrow slit
to the west overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the
Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the
guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the east leads back outside.

furnishings meant for pure functionality.  Built from the same

the smallest light into brightness.  The arrow slits and lanterns set into
the walls provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an
arrow slit to the south overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of South
Harbor, and a few of the ships and boats in the beautiful Ogier-built basin.
The view through an arrow slit to the west overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
down deeper into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the north leads out
atop the long wall that runs the length of the island.

village of Alindaer on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The South Harbor guard tower is to the south.  The wall continues

shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Alindaer on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The wall continues on to the north and to the south.

Alindaer Gate Guard Tower~
This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional only.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone
as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set into the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The wonderful view through an arrow slit to the
west overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle
Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the village of Alindaer, and the bridge
that connects it with the gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
deeper down into the guard tower.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to
the south lead back outside atop the city wall.

This is a section of the city wall that is above the Alindaer Gate and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Alindaer
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

The Top of the Southharbor Steps~
Here atop the steps that lead down into Southharbor there is a fine view
of the Ogier-built basin.  Surrounded by the white walls that almost
completely encircle the basin, the wide gates stand open to the south to
allow vessels access to the harbor.  Dozens of dockworkers can be seen
unloading and loading cargo from ships all along the wharf.  The majority of
the wharf has a long roof to cover it.  There are also a few warehouses
along the wharf for storing the merchants' goods, though none rise higher
than four stories.  The streets of Southharbor are of tightly-paved
cobblestone, in contrast with the rest of the city.  Unlike the beautiful
white marble bridges that cross Tar Valon, wooden bridges cross between the
buildings and wharf of Southharbor giving it a more practical air than the
fancy of the city.  From the bridges and various beams that cross the docks,
lanterns hang allowing the dockmen to work both day and night.

The Bottom of the Southharbor Steps~
All along the harbor dockworkers, cargo handlers, sailors and merchants
go about their duties in a hurried pace, wasting no time as they load and
unload their cargo.  The noise of the wharf is a little overwhelming here. 
The harbor arcs around each side to nearly meet at its southern tip, where
the harbor gates stand open.  The steps here lead up out of the harbor and
into the city.

The Southharbor Wharf~
There is a lot of activity here at the wharf from the sailors and
dockworkers busily moving cargo between the warehouses and ships.  There is
quite a bit of noise here due to the merchants shouting orders to the
dockworkers.  The bowl-shape of the harbor is visible here, from the way the
wharf curves along the east and west towards the harbor gates at the
southern tip of the harbor.  The steps to the west lead up, out of the
harbor, and into the city of Tar Valon.

The Southharbor Wharf~
Here at the edge of the wharf the water laps gently against the seawall. 
Many dockworkers and sailors move about the wharf, transfering goods to and
from the warehouses and ships.  There is a lot of noise here at the wharf
from merchants shouting orders to the dockworkers.  To the east and west the
wharf curves around towards the harbor entrance to the south.  The steps to
the north lead up, out of the harbor, and into the city of Tar Valon. 
Unlike the rest of the city of Tar Valon, it is not stone bridges but wooden
onbes that cross the buildings and wharf of Southharbor.  The normal
flagstone of the city has also been replaced by tightly-paved cobblestone,
which shows no less wear than the white marble of the northern glory.

The Southharbor Wharf~
Here at the edge of the wharf the water laps gently against the seawall. 
There is quite a bit of noise here due to the merchants shouting orders to
the dockworkers.  Many sailors and dockworkers busily move cargo between the
warehouses and ships.  To the east and west the wharf curves around towards
the harbor entrance to the south.  Several ships and boats are moored by
their stern all along the wharf.  Unlike the rest of the city of Tar Valon,
it is not stone bridges but wooden onbes that cross the buildings and wharf
of Southharbor.  The normal flagstone of the city has also been replaced by
tightly-paved cobblestone, which shows no less wear than the white marble of
the northern glory.

The Top of the North Harbor Steps~
Here atop the steps that lead down into North Harbor there is a fine view
of the Ogier-built basin.  Surrounded by the white walls that almost
completely encircle the basin, the wide gates stand open to the north to
allow vessels access to the harbor.  Dozens of dockworkers can be seen
unloading and loading cargo from ships all along the wharf.  The majority of
the wharf has a long roof to cover it.  There are also a few warehouses
along the wharf for storing the merchants' goods.

The Bottom of the North Harbor Steps~
The noise of the wharf is overwhelming here.  The harbor arcs around each
side to nearly meet at its northern tip, where the harbor gates stand open. 
All along the harbor dockworkers, cargo handlers, sailors and merchants go
about their duties in a hurried pace, wasting no time as they load and
unload their cargo.  The steps here lead up out of the harbor and into the
city.

Alindaer Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrow slits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrow slit to the west
overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A
set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy
oak door to the north leads back outside.

Through the Alindaer Gate~
Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Alindaer spans to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  To the east, the beautiful
city of Tar Valon awaits, with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and
amazing towers of every shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north
and to the south lead into the guard towers.

Alindaer Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrow slit to the west
overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A
set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy
oak door to the south leads back outside.

Alindaer Avenue~
This is an incredible city.  A city which no words can describe, and only
the gasps of those who see it for the first time can truly capture the
essence of Tar Valon's beauty.  Beautiful towers rise high above the ground
in various spiral, fluted and flared designs.  A few of the towers even have
bridges that span the heights to connect the towers.  Here the street is
paved in large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the
many visitors who travel this avenue.  Many small parks can be seen along
the avenue, as well as a few gardens.  The Alindaer Gate is to the west,
while the avenue continues on to the east.

This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The wonderful view through an arrow slit to the

Erinin.  Also visible to the east is the village of Luagde, and the bridge
that connects it with the gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
deeper down into the guard tower.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to

along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the east, across the section of

Intersection of Daghain Avenue and East Teardrop Way~
This is the most beautiful city in the world, and no man or woman who has
ever been here in Tar Valon could deny it.  The most amazing towers rise
from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs, and every
tower is crafted in the whitest stone known to man or Ogier.  Several of the
towers have bridges that span the heights between them and other towers,
creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges catch the light
and glimmer brightly.  To the west rises the tallest and most beautiful of

Daghain Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrow slit to the east
overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  A
set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy
oak door to the north leads back outside.

Daghain Avenue~
This is the most beautiful city in the world, and no man or woman who has
ever been here in Tar Valon could deny it.  The most amazing towers rise
from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs, and every
tower is crafted in the whitest stone known to man or Ogier.  Several of the
towers have bridges that span the heights between them and other towers,
creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges catch the light
and glimmer brightly.  To the west rises the tallest and most beautiful of
all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the street is paved in
large flagstones that provide a level footing for the many visitors who
travel this avenue.  The Daghain Gate is to the east, leading out of the
city to the bridge that crosses the River Erinin.  A small garden is to the
south, providing a place for travellers to rest.

Above the Osenrein Gate~
This is a section of the city wall that is above the Osenrein Gate, and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin, is the village of Osenrein.
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

Osenrein Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrow slit to the east
overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  A
set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy
oak door to the south leads back outside.

Through the Osenrein Gate~
Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Osenrein spans to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  To the west, the beautiful
city of Tar Valon awaits, with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and
amazing towers of every shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north
and to the south lead into the guard towers.

Here in the highest part of the guard tower, there are only sparse
furnishings meant solely for their functionality.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even
the smallest light into brightness.  The arrow slits and lanterns set in the
walls provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an
arrow slit to the south overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of South Harbor
and a few of the ships and boats in the beautiful Ogier-built basin.  The
view through an arrow slit to the east overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
downwards deeper into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the north

Osenrein Avenue~
With every turn of the head, Tar Valon brings wonder to all who gaze
about the city.  Beautiful towers rise high above the ground in various
spiral, fluted and flared designs.  A few of the towers even have bridges
that span the heights to connect the towers.  Here the street is paved in
large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the many
visitors who travel this way.  Many small parks can be seen along the way,
as well as a few gardens.  The avenue continues on towards the White Tower
to the north, or out of the city to the south.

Atop the East City Wall~
This is the walkway atop the beautiful long wall that protects the east
shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the east, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the east is the
village of Osenrein on the opposite bank of the river.  To the west is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The wall continues on to the east and to the south.

the city of Tar Valon to the east.  The openwork waist-high walls of the
bridge are as detailed and as beautiful as any lacework imaginable.  The
city walls of Tar Valon dominate the view to the east.  Overwhelming and
breath-taking, the high walls and the towers that interrupt the walls at
intervals are made from the same gleaming white, silver-streaked stone that
most of Tar Valon is built from.  The bridge arches towards Alindaer to the
west and connects seamlessly with the city walls of Tar Valon to the east. 
Far below, the section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin
flows past unhindered as the bridge spans from shore to shore with no
supports in between.

Entrance to the Ogier Grove~
This is the entrance into the ogier grove, an opening in the unusual wall
that surrounds it.  The wall is actually an endless series of spiraling
stone arches, five spans high and twice as wide.  Through the spaces in
between the arches, people can be seen bustling along the street outside the
a delicate ideal between the two in its own natural growth and beauty.  To
the south, the Great Trees dwarf all below them.  A small gate to the north
leads back out to the street.

The Ogier Grove in Tar Valon~
Here in the grove, the Great Trees dwarf all below them.  The many elm,
oak, leatherleaf and fir trees seem small beneath the canopy of even one
Great Tree.  While not as wild as a forest nor as tame as a park, this grove
seems a delicate ideal between the two in its own natural growth and beauty.
All surroundings quickly become similar and sight is limited by the thick
foliage of the grove.  Only trees and undergrowth are visible in every
direction.

for sale, from simple sandals and work boots, to the more complex.  The
cobbler takes great pride in crafting only the finest boots and shoes in the

This is a shop of wealth, and a shop for the wealthy.  Many pieces of
jewelry are on display.  The jewelry here is some of the finest in the land,
in both value and beauty.  The shop owner cautiously watches all of his
customers and treasures, making sure not a single one goes unsupervised. 
With all of the gold, silver, and precious gems here, the shop owner should
probably hire a guard for protection.  No doubt he must feel safe having his
shop this close to the White Tower.

who have the coin to convince the shopkeeper otherwise.

A School of Weapons and Tactics~
This room is very large and very well-lit.  The floor is multi-level, and
padded in some places.  Where the floor is not padded, the hardwood planks
have been swept clean.  The floor rises and falls, creating various levels
for the students to train from, learning different tactics for each stance
required.  A few wooden practice weapons have been set in corners, but most
of them have been put away in the large rack against one wall.  The old
Warder patiently instructs his students in tactics, strategies and physical
training.  To the west is the infirmary for the students who require rest or
more serious attention to their wounds.

There are several tools and containers throughout the shop that are used in

woman money, her flowers are her passion and will always keep longer than
the herbs and mixtures do.

for an inn to have rugs in a room that the patrons rarely visit.  The door
to the north leads into the kitchen, and the door to the south leads out
into the stable yard.

standards.  Several buckets sit on the ground throughout the shop with
arrows in various stages of progress.  Many buckets towards the rear of the
shop contain only the bare shafts, while many at the front contain complete
arrows ready for inspection and to be placed into a quiver.  Several quivers
line the walls as well as a few bows, while all the bows are of the same
design.  Normally it is the quality of the arrow that matters, as most bows
are principally the same.

This room is musty smelling, with the tinge of coin in the air.  Several
strong-boxes can be seen to the rear of this office, protected by very large
locks.  A few piles of gold and silver coins sit atop a counter, as the
money lender totals up how many are in each pile before puttings the coins
in locked boxes.  Set atop the counter are other devices as well, such as
scales and weights, all used to discern an honest man's coin from that of a
rogue's.  The money lender of Tar Valon is a thrifty man, seeing all the
guile that robs other merchants from a few shaved coins here and a few
shaved coins there.

A Guest Room~
This is one of the several guest rooms.  The floor's hardwood plank
floors have been swept and covered with several small throw rugs.  Many
tapestries line the walls, with nice curtains around the single window in
the room.  The window provides a nice view of Tar Valon.  Several fine
towers can be seen from the view, many with the bridges that span the
heights between them.  The very comfortable-looking bed completes the cozy

hot water for the patrons to bathe and relax in.

Main Room of a Small Orphanage~
This large home was donated to the city years ago and qas quickly
renovated as an orphanage for the urchin children of Tar Valon and the
surrounding countryside.  This room serves as a waiting area, where vistors
can be greeted and the children can gather.  The room is kept clean and
there are very few furnishings.  Through the door to the north, the bustle
of Tar Valon intrudes on the orphanage, while children can be heard giggling
through the door east.  A hallway exits the waiting room south and the
dining area lies west.

has left the floor rough with a few splinters.  The hallway continues to the
south, and the main room is to the north.  A playroom is to the east, and

A Small Study~
This room serves as a study for the children, but due to limited funds
there are no desks for the children and they must do their writing and
reading on the floor.  Very few books are available to the children, and
most of them are tattered and worn.  A few small windows overlook the street
and the many people making their way by and occasionally looking in the
window at the children.  The door to the west leads back to the main room of
the orphanage.

This is the dining room for the orphans.  Several small tables and low
benches are set up around this large room, built small intentionally for the
children in mind.  Quite a bit of food has been carelessly dropped on the
floor, creating a nasty mess.  The main room of the orphanage is to the
east, while the kitchen is to the south.

The Orphanage Kitchen~
This kitchen is very clean, except for a few hard to reach corners, where
the dust and debris seem to have piled up over the years.  The smell of the
last meal cooked still hangs heavy in the air.  The stone fire-pit set in
one wall has since cooled, and the large cauldron cleaned.  The cook table
has been cleaned and scrubbed for the next meal that is being prepared.  The
dining room is to the north, and the hallway to the east.

This room is a mess!  Several toys and games lie scattered all across the
floor.  Dolls missing heads, arms, and/or legs are strewn about carelessly. 
Piles of half-destroyed toys are pushed into each corner to make enough
clear space on the floor for the children to play.  A game of snakes and
foxes is set up near the window, but obviously missing several game-pieces.

A Dank Tattoo Parlor~
This shop is digustingly filthy.  A person could be diseased just walking
into a place like this.  Ink has been dripped on the floor, mixed with blood
and other bodily fluids of unknown origin.  Several needles are strewn about
the room, most of them in rubbish piles, or casually set down in filth. 
Many of the small inkpots used for the tattoos have a covering of a slimy
mold on top of the ink.  A person should remember that all tattoos are
PERMANENT before coming to such an establishment.

The Infirmary~
This room serves as an infirmary for the students.  Sometimes those who
come to learn over-exert themselves or become wounded in a fierce spar. 
Very rarely, a student becomes injured enough to require the Aes Sedai's
healing touch, but if needed, she is here to help (after a small donation
that goes to the city orphanage).  The room is well-lit, and smells lightly
of rose petals.  The sounds of clashing weapons come from the training room
to the east.  (Type 'heal' for a full listing of the Aes Sedai's services).

All these objects seem to have been refurbished.  In the back of the shop
sits the gilder, busy working on an old piece of furniture.  On the back
wall are many tools of his trade, from paint brushes and various paints and
enamels to etching tools and carving knives.

of silk can be seen at the rear of the shop.  Several needles, scissors, and
spools of silk thread lie atop the shelves of this shop.

This cellar is very dark and disturbing.  The heavy stone walls are wet
with condensation, and slick with mold and mildew.  Rough flagstone makes up
the floor down here in the cellar.  The ceiling hangs low due to the weight
on the beams that support the flooring of the inn up above.  Some sounds are
coming from the north.  A short ladder leads back up through the secret
hatch.

A Pet Seller~
Suprisingly enough would this shop be one that sells pets.  The white
marble walls of this shop are a vision of animals racing through a forest,
captured forever in stone.  The scene is one of nature's joy.  Set about
this shop are a few dozen cages, each holding different types of pets from
kittens and puppies to large hunting hounds.  The echoes of the animals ring
throughout the shop, louder than the keeper or the bell hanging from the
door, as if they sense another family is about to bring them a new home.

shopkeeper only sells the items he purchases, but does not make them.  He
imports his weapons and armor from other countries, and sometimes purchases
what peddlers bring to him if the quality is good enough.

A Weapon and Armor Shop~
This shop sells weapons and armor that is fit for most soldiers,
infantry, and adventurers.  The armor hangs from pegs along the walls, and
the weapons are displayed upon several racks designed specifically to hold
each weapon.  Towards the rear of the shop is the forge, anvil and workshop
that the smith uses to make his weapons and armor.  Above the forge is an
iron shaft used to help ventilate this large workshop, as the heat and smoke
get very oppressive.

The Depths of the Grove~
An iron fencing surrounds this area of the garden, though for what
purpose can only be imagined.  Like the rest of the Ogier Grove, this closed
off garden seems an ideal of nature, it has neither the tame look of a park
nor the wild of an untamed forest.  The stout iron fence is lost in the
trees to the left and right, curving as it stretches around this section of
the grove.  Atop the iron fence are freshly sharpened iron spikes, looking
as if they could puncture through platemail armor without any trouble.

A Small Garden~
This is a small garden set away from the street for travellers to rest a
bit before continuing on.  The peacefulness and fresh air help the
travellers to rest up a bit.  The fine plants and flowers scattered
throughout the garden bring out the natural beauty of Tar Valon to
compliment the man and ogier-built buildings.  Flowers of heartsblush,
jumpup, and morningstar brighten the garden and lighten the soul, as they
set the garden aglow in a wash of reds, pinks, and whites.  Many people sit
in the garden, gaining not just rest from their wanderings in the city, but
relaxation from the tranquility of the surroundings.

A Private Training Room~
This is a small room that is used for more private studies, training, and
sparring.  The hardwood planks that line the floor have been swept and
scrubbed clean, yet there are still some bloodstains that have been soaked
into the grain of the planks.  The room is devoid of any decoration or
furniture, leaving the area open for ease of movement.  The main training
area is to the south.

A School of Weapons and Tactics~
This room is very large and very well-lit.  The floor is multi-level and
padded in some places.  Where the floor is not padded, the hardwood planks
have been swept clean.  The floor rises and falls, creating various levels
for the students to train from, learning different tactics for each stance
required.  A few wooden practice weapons have been set in corners, but most
of them have been put away in the large rack against one wall.

Tremalking Splice~
This smoke-filled tavern is called The Tremalking Splice.  Known by
sailors and other disreputable types to be one of the finest dicing taverns
north of Tear, this tavern is full of people interested in only dicing and
drinking.  A lot of dirt and debris covers the floor of the tavern.  In this
room several dice games are being played, no two alike, but in other rooms,
they play only specific games to keep things simple.

This cobblestone sidestreet is twisting and very dark.  Several corners
and niches are so darkly shadowed that nothing is visible within them. 
Every window along this sidestreet is shuttered, which is very unusual for
Tar Valon.  Most of the buildings here are only a single story, and all have
a tiled roof that is near flat.  The sidestreet continues to the east and

South Guard Barracks~
This building serves as a place for the guard of Tar Valon to rest and
sleep, and still be close to their post.  Since the Tower grounds lie at the
center of the city, there is a need to keep guards close by to the north and
south harbors.  This barracks has a low ceiling, barely above a grown man's
head.  Several candles are in holders along the wall, providing an ample
amount of light for the room.  This particular room of the barracks serves
as a meeting place for the guard when off duty.  The men usually play a
little dice, or tend to their weapons and equipment here.  To the east and
west are the sleeping quarters of the guard.  To the north is the sleeping
quarters for the officers.  The door to the south leads back outside.
